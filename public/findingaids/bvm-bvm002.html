            <a name="a2">Background </a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Sister Callista Campion:
Sister Callista Campion was born on March 1, 1891 in Milton, Wisconsin.
Her parents, Edward and Esther Carroll Campion named her Alice.
Her parents died while she was a child and she was raised by her aunt, who kept house for her uncle, Father Carroll.
He was a German scholar and passed his love of the language onto his niece.
At the age of 16, she toured Europe with her aunt and uncle.
In Rome, the family had a private audience with Pope Pius X.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">She attended boarding school at Mount St. Joseph Academy in Dubuque, Iowa.
The school was run by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVMs).
She entered the congregation on September 8, 1912, was received on March 19, 1913 (when she received her religious name Callista), made first vows on March 19, 1915, and final vows on August 15, 1918.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">From 1915 to 1929, she taught school at various locations in the Midwest.
She completed her Bachelor's degree from DePaul University in 1922, her Master's degree in German from the University of Illinois in 1930, and a PhD in German from the University of Illinois in 1940.
In 1930, she began teaching at Mundelein College in Chicago, where she remained until her death in 1957.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">While at Mundelein College, Sister Callista began corresponding with Berta Hummel, Sister Maria Innocentia, a Franciscan sister from a convent in Siessen, Germany.
Sister Callista began collecting postcards created from Sister Innocentia's drawings.
During WWII, the Siessen convent was taken over by the Nazis.
Sister Callista would send food, clothing and other items to the convent and Sister Innocentia would send pencil and watercolor sketches as thanks.
Sister Callista continued to send aid even after Sister Innocentia's death in 1946; she also continued to collect Hummel related materials until her death on October 16, 1957.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Sister Maria Innocentia (Berta) Hummel :
Berta Hummel was born in Massing, Bavaria on May 21, 1909.
Her parents were Adolf and Victoria Hummel and she was one of six children.
Her artistic talent was evident even as a child.
In 1927, she enrolled in the Academy of Applied Arts in Munich.
She graduated first in her class.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">While attending school in Munich, she lived in a Catholic residence run by sisters.
While living there, she became friends with two members of the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of Siessen who were also studying at the Academy.
In 1931, soon after graduation, she entered the Siessen convent.
She was received in August 22, 1931 and took the name Sister Maria Innocentia.
She professed final vows on August 30, 1937.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Her drawings were first released as postcards by a publishing house in Stuttgart.
In 1934, it published a collection of her drawings in Das Hummel-Buch.
One year later, the Goebel porcelain company received permission to make figurines based on her drawings and they were immediately successful.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Shortly after the Nazis came to power, they banned the distribution of her art.
She had personally offended Adolf Hitler after she released a painting called The Volunteers, which depicted untidy and unkempt children dressed in clothing similar to SA uniforms captioned with a plea for peace.
In 1940, the Nazis seized the Siessen convent and forced much of the community to leave.
Sister Innocentia left the convent, but received permission to return several months later.
She continued her artistic endeavors and, though the Nazis seized half of her profits, the remaining half was the primary source of income for the convent.
It was during this time period that Sister Callista and Sister Innocentia corresponded.
In 1945, the convent was liberated by the French.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1944, Sister Innocentia was diagnosed with tuberculosis.
She died on November 6, 1946 and was buried in the Siessen convent cemetery.</p>
