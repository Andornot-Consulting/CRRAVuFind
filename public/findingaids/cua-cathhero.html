            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">American Catholics were justly proud of their co-religionists who served in World War I, especially those who recognized for valor. Catholics have always been a minority in the United States, with population percentages increasing, mostly through immigration, from one percent during the American Revolution, ten percent in the American Civil War, seventeen percent in World War I, and about twenty two percent in the early twenty first century. Supporting the American war effort in World War I would be a watershed for Catholics who were largely viewed as an immigrant institution with questionable patriotism. They responded under the motto of "For God and Country," creating the National Catholic War Council (NCWC), the forerunner of the twenty-first century United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Admiral William Shepherd Benson (1855-1932) of Georgia, would serve as the Chief of Naval Operations, the highest ranking of over 800,000 Catholics in the U.S. military. The creation of the NCWC at a meeting on the campus of The Catholic University of America (CUA) in Washington, D.C. to support Catholics in the military impressed President Woodrow Wilson. He wrote to Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore, stating he appreciated "so large a sense of patriotism and so admirable a spirit of devotion to our common country." The NCWC would be ably led by a remarkable priest from New York City, John Burke, C.S.P., a Catholic newspaper editor who had already been working to supply Catholic chaplains to the United States military. Under Burke, the NCWC, in partnership with the Knights of Columbus, worked to represent Catholic interests in the Congress, address the needs of soldiers and war workers at home and overseas, and promote acceptance and integration of recent, mostly Catholic immigrants from eastern and southern Europe as well as Mexico.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The NCWC also engaged in ecumenical cooperation with Protestants and Jews on a committee chaired by Burke to advise the U.S. military on religious matters relating to soldiers' training at home and serving in the field along with civilian war workers. Success in providing leadership for the growth and development of the U.S. Catholic Church induced hierarchies in other countries to replicate the NCWC's organization. The American bishops also realized this united wartime effort was crucial to effective protection of Church interests in peacetime, so they made the NCWC a permanent organization. The National Catholic Welfare Council, also known (confusingly) as the NCWC, formally took over the work of the National Catholic War Council. In 1922, the name was changed to the National Catholic Welfare Conference, and was immediately faced by a major act of organized anti-Catholicism with the Oregon School Bill, recently approved by state voters, declaring children could only attend public schools. Supported by the Ku Klux Klan, who discriminated against Catholics and other minorities, this was a serious blow to educational freedom. The NCWC mobilized a public campaign in opposition and in 1925 the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the Oregon School Bill. This attack against and successful defense of parochial schools proved the need for the NCWC's continued existence to combat anti-Catholic prejudice.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The 1928 American presidential election was the occasion of the first Catholic to head a major party ticket. Al Smith of New York was the Democratic Party nominee. Smith lost to Republican Herbert Hoover and it would not be until 1960 with John Fitzgerald Kennedy that another Catholic would run, and this time win the presidency. During the 1928 campaign, Smith and Catholics generally had been subjected to all manner of abuse and innuendo as papists subservient to the Vatican. For the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC), especially Daniel J. Ryan who headed their Bureau of Historical Records, it must have seemed that all their work over the past decade to document American Catholic patriotism had seemingly been for naught. The Bureau had taken over the function of the War Council's historical records committee, created to maintain a national Catholic archives for the preservation and use of materials dealing with Catholic war activities. A primary goal was and continued to be to gather evidence to counter bigoted charges that American Catholics were not patriotic. Never faint hearted and with the records of 800,000 Catholic veterans available, Ryan began in December 1928 to write and supply to the feature service of the National Catholic News Service a weekly column on outstanding 'Catholic Heroes of the World War.' Generally, those profiled were men, and some women, who had won the Congressional Medal of Honor (CMH), the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), and/or the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM). As of 1931, Catholics had won 15 of 92 CMHs, 486 of 6,015 DSCs, and 49 of 1,335 DSMs.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">According to the Bureau's 1929 annual report, the feature was well received by former servicemen, their parents, chaplains, and others, who noted the accuracy of the feature articles. The Catholic Heroes of the World War column continued until 1933, ending perhaps not coincidentally, in the same year that the Catholic friendly Franklin Delano Roosevelt assumed the Office of the President, though it should be noted that the NCWC decided to close the Bureau of Historical Records down in 1934 citing lack of funds. Back in the 1930 annual report, Ryan had explained the Catholic Heroes series hoped to deal with Catholic heroes from every state and diocese, if possible, and that so far there had been 98 stories featuring 46 states and the District of Columbia (DC). In the 1931 report, Ryan related there were now 141 stories covering the then 48 states and all but 7 Catholic dioceses. By the time the column ended in 1933 there were about 250 stories in all.

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The columns, about 250 in all, were written between 1928 and 1933 by Daniel J. Ryan, head of the NCWC Bureau of Historical Records. Generally each story profiles one individual, usually soldiers but the occasional nurse as well. There are also instances of stories being about two individuals. Apparently Ryan kept a record of them by putting the clippings in a scrapbook, alphabetically by surname. The scrapbook itself was unremarkable, hard cover with yellow, numbered, onionskin paper. The cover was acidic and falling apart, and many of the pages torn or disintegrating. The clippings themselves were in fairly good shape, though many yellowing with acid. The page numbers do not appear to be relevant to any organization of the stories. Because of the poor condition and otherwise unremarkable status the scrapbook was dismantled, the clipping photocopied onto acid free paper and the clippings and copies individually housed in acid free folders and filed alphabetically in series one. The publication date of each column was not always given, so it was not possible, at this time, to organize the columns chronologically. Additionally, some incidental items, such as the scrapbook's alphabetical index and a working file related to the column, make up the second and last series. </p>
