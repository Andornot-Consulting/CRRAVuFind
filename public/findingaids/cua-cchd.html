            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Development (later the Catholic Campaign for Human Development) was founded in November 1969 as a national public education and development program by the United States Catholic Conference (now known as the USCCB). The campaign was implemented with two goals: the first goal was an educational effort to inform Americans about the extent of poverty in the country and the second was to raise funds for projects combating poverty. During the first decade of the organization's history, most of the funding was allocated to grassroots programs to aid the poor through economic cooperatives in inner city neighborhoods, cooperative medical clinics, economic development programs, legal aid for discrimination, bi-lingual media outlets, and housing developments. Most of these grant programs also aimed toward disadvantaged minority groups such as Native Americans, Latinos, and African Americans. They also sponsored job training programs during the mid-1970s recession for depressed areas in Appalachia and other areas in the northeast.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In order to achieve the goal of educating the nation, the CCHD developed media outlets to spread the message about American poverty. For example, they developed a working relationship with the both Franciscan Commission of the Council of Churches and the Curriculum Development Center of The Catholic University of America (CUA). The CCHD was very successful at raising funds for their projects, and on November 22, 1970, they broke the USCC record by raising, via church collection, $8.5 million. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The main areas of focus for CCHD grant projects are employment opportunity, health, housing, education, social action, legal rights, and community organization. The self-help aspect of the organization's goals is two-fold: in order for a program to have been funded it must be approved by the national committee and must meet the criteria that the project would be run by the poor themselves. Since 1970, the CCHD has given $75 million dollars in grants and has aided 215 projects annually.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The CCHD records are divided into nine series, and were processed according to the principles of More Product Less Process  (MPLP), which indicates general box listings rather than more detailed folder listings. The first seven series are files from approved grant projects, consisting largely of correspondence, financial reports, mission statements, and progress reports. The first series contains approved grant information for anti-poverty and self-help projects in the northeast United States. Area A consists of projects from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, and Puerto Rico. These projects were dedicated to legal assistance, job training, fair housing, and food cooperatives. Also, there were projects for neighborhood economic development. The second series contains all approved grant information for anti-poverty and self-help projects in Area B, which mainly consists of the mid-Atlantic states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and Maryland. These projects were dedicated to poverty outreach and job training for African-Americans, as well as legal assistance in combating discrimination.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series contains approved grant information for anti-poverty and self-help projects in Area C, which mainly consists of states in the southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and the Virgin Islands. Much of this material concerns aid the rural poor, in particular poor African-Americans in Mississippi and Alabama, as well as economic development and medical assistance to the poor in Appalachia. The next series contains all approved grant information and correspondence for anti-poverty and self-help projects in Area D, consisting of states in the west: Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The funded projects in this region aid neighborhood development in the inner-city, job training for Latinos, and anti-poverty programs for Native Americans. Lastly, there are files on legal assistance programs for Native Americans to reclaim ownership of their lands.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fifth series contains of all approved grant information and correspondence for anti-poverty and self-help projects in Area E, which mainly consists of states in the mountainous west and southwest: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. Most of these funded projects are for programs for Native Americans and Latinos. The programs for Latinos are for job training, economic cooperatives, and bi-lingual media outlets. The sixth series contains of approved grant information and correspondence for anti-poverty and self-help projects in Area F, which mainly consists of states on the Pacific Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii. These programs aid Latinos, migrant workers, and Inuit tribes. Also, the programs focus on job training, bilingual outreach, housing development, economic cooperatives, and legal assistance. The seventh series contains correspondence of funded grant programs with the national office of the CCHD in Washington, D.C. Progress reports for various projects and requests for further funding comprise the majority of this correspondence. Some of the correspondence also concerns mission statements and goals of each newly funded project.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The eighth series contains various leaflets and brochures of grant projects from 1977-1978. Included also are a few small posters advertising the CCHD and the services they provide to further social justice and anti-poverty initiatives. The last series contains research conducted by Drs. Paul Sullins and John McCarthy from 1978-2001. Most of this research consists of surveys tracking the progress of projects and studying if self-help organizations are successful and sustainable with CCHD funding. The surveys provide great insight into the different types of self-help programs funded by the CCHD and the different demographics that they have served. Overall, the CCHD can be helpful to researchers working with Latino outreach within the Catholic Church in America during the 1970s, as well as poverty outreach with other minority groups during the 1970s. </p>
