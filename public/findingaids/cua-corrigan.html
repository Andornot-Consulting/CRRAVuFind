</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Joseph Moran Corrigan was born on May 18, 1879 in Philadelphia to Daniel David Corrigan and Mary Moran Corrigan. He attended Catholic School for his entire education including Cathedral School, La Salle College Prep, Overbrook Seminary, and the Pontifical College of North America in Rome. He earned his Ph.D. and S.T.D. there in 1898 and 1903 respectively. Corrigan was ordained a priest in 1903 and became a professor of Dogmatic Theology at St. Charles Seminary in Overbrook Pennsylvania, the same seminary he attended. He would remain a professor until 1925 when he was appointed rector of the seminary. In 1929 Pope Pius XI appointed him Domestic Prelate which would lead to his great notoriety within the American Hierarchy. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
The epoch of his career came in 1936 he was appointed rector of The Catholic University of America by Pope Pius XI. This was followed by his appointment as a Prothonotary Apostolic in 1937, and Titular Bishop of Bilta in 1940. His accomplishments at Catholic University include the construction of Curly Hall, then known as Priest and Faculty residence. He was also responsible for establishing the Committee on American Citizenship on campus, as an organization that defended American Catholicism within the American system of government. Also, the university celebrated its fiftieth anniversary during his rectory and, received a visit by Pope Pius XII, then Cardinal Eugenio Giuseppe Pacelli, in 1936. Corrigan's health however deteriorated throughout 1941-1942 until on June 9, after a three day bout of pneumonia, after a lengthy speaking tour, died at Georgetown Hospital at the age of 63. Bishop Corrigan is best remembered as a great orator and educator in Catholic education, and his involvement in the Knights of Columbus where he served as Pennsylvania State Chaplain for many years.</p>
