During the administration of President Rev. James Hugh Ryan (1928-1935), Ryan appointed a consultant to develop an outline for the public relations department.  However, at the time the new department could not be funded.  During President Joseph M. Corrigan's appointment (1936-1942), a Bureau of Public Relations was established.  While the first chosen director for the Bureau of Public Relations decided to accept a position at Columbia University instead, the second director served throughout President Rev. Patrick J. McCormick's (1943-1953) administration.  While the director's name is unknown, the position itself was limited to a single professional and thus the concern of the position was primarily with publicity in the press (Nuesse, 1990, 365).</p><p style="margin-left: 30pt">Over the 1950s and 1960s, the Bureau of Public Relations continued to evolve.  The name "Bureau of Public Relations" continued until 1968 when it was changed to "Public Relations" until 1980.  In 1981, the department's name was changed to "University Relations" until 1982, which was replaced with the currently known "Office of Public Affairs."  The department has also evolved over the past sixty years; from a single professional operation its services now include Advertising, Photography, Design Services, and Publicity ("Public Affairs," 2011).</p><p style="margin-left: 30pt">The images documented in the Public Affairs Photographic Collection depict major events and activities that took place at the Catholic University of America since the 1970s.  The images also portray, but are not limited to, students in classrooms, faculty, staff, and student headshots, CUA related events that were not located on campus, and campus shots from different viewpoints and different seasons.</p><p style="margin-left: 30pt">Directors of the Office of Public Affairs:</p>1967-1969:  Ron C.
