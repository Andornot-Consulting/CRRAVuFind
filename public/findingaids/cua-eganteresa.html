          <p style="margin-left : 30pt">The photographic material, which had been removed from the main body of the collection and placed in unlabeled folders, was also rearranged thematically and reintegrated with the collection. All photographs and negatives were also sleeved for protection.</p>

            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Blessed Mother Teresa of Kolkata (1910-1997) and Eileen Egan (1912-2000) represent two Catholic women who played a central role in the Church's international work in the latter half of the twentieth century. Coming from different backgrounds, these two women nevertheless shared much in common, including a deep interest in alleviating the suffering of their fellow humans. While they did not meet until they were both in their mid-forties, they nevertheless managed to form a close personal and working relationship that would span the remainder of their lives.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Mother Teresa and Eileen Egan spent the first few decades of their lives in a similar fashion. Raised by Catholic families in regions with few other Catholics, the young Teresa and Egan nevertheless found a strong core of faith within their domestic settings. In their teens, both women left their home countries and settled in regions wherein they would remain the rest of their lives. In the 1940's, they each experienced a calling to aid those ravaged by poverty, disease, and conflict. While Egan put her organizational and journalistic skills towards refugee relief, Teresa began the initial steps in founding a new religious order devoted towards tending the sick, poor, and dying. In 1955, they would meet for the first time in the slums of Calcutta. Out of this initial meeting, Teresa and Egan would strike up a close friendship and collaboration that would endure for the following four decades.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 27, 1910 in Skopje, Yugoslavia. A precociously spiritual child, she was inspired at an early age by the work of the local Jesuits, who had sent a number of members to work in India. At the age of 18, Agnes joined the Loreto nuns of Ireland, an order with a presence in Calcutta. After her brief postulancy in Ireland, she was sent to India in 1929 to teach in the order's St. Mary's High School in Calcutta. She would remain as the school's geography teacher until 1948.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1946, however, she experienced what she later termed as a "day of decision," in which she was inspired to live outside the cloister and to work directly with the poor. She applied to Rome in 1948 and was granted a one-year leave of absence to work in the Calcutta slums. Upon receiving this grant, she took up the white and blue sari and went into the streets of the city to care for the sick and dying, never to return to the cloister. At the end of this year, Teresa was encouraged to continue in her work and began to build for the foundation of a new religious order, the Missionaries of Charity. By 1950, she had her first postulants in the new order.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Eileen Egan was a Catholic journalist, activist, and pacifist. Born in Wales in 1912, her family immigrated to New York City when she was 14, where she would remain a lifelong resident. Following her studies in journalism at Hunter College, she was inspired by the social outreach and pacifism of Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker movement. As the clouds of war descended upon Europe in the 1940's, Ms. Egan traveled to Portugal and reported on the state of wartime refugees in that country. Upon issuing this report, she was offered a job as the first layperson with the newly-founded War Relief Services, later Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Her lifelong concern for refugees would be further aroused by her first assignment with the agency, working to relocate 700 freed Poles from their Siberian exile to northern Mexico.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In the next decade, she would continue working on refugee issues in war-ravaged Europe and Asia before being placed in the CRS India office. In 1955, during a fact-finding tour for Catholic Relief Services, Egan and Teresa met for the first time. A lifelong friendship and collaboration between the two women would develop out of this initial meeting. Egan would continue to visit and correspond with Teresa and her order over the next several years. Finally, in 1960, she extended an invitation to Teresa to address the National Council of Catholic Women during their annual convention in Las Vegas. Accepting the invitation, Mother Teresa made her first trip abroad since her arrival in India at the age of 19. This would also mark the first in a long line of international journeys that the nun and Egan would make together over the next several decades.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">At this time, Teresa's initial vision for her order began to expand. The Co-Workers of Mother Teresa was established in the late 1950's to unite laymen and women across the globe in supporting and expanding the Missionaries' mission of aiding the sick and poor. Having established her first non-Indian house in Venezuela in 1965, the Missionaries of Charity was also blessed as an order of pontifical right in the same year.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">As her fame grew outside her adopted homeland, invitations and honors began to flood into the otherwise shy nun's community in Calcutta. Having achieved worldwide recognition for her work through the publicity of followers such as Egan, and the press that came with winning the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, Teresa traveled the world, speaking on the issues of the day and establishing new communities of both the Missionaries of Charity and the Co-Workers. She would continue in this pattern throughout the final years of her life, before passing away on September 5, 1997.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">After her initial meeting with Teresa, Egan became a major supporter of the Missionaries of Charity and their lay counterpart, the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa. Often acting as both the coordinator and travel companion for Teresa's many international travels, Egan also contributed to the Co-Workers' newsletters and meetings. Simultaneously, known for her work on the behalf of peace, Egan was one of several American witnesses who addressed the Second Vatican Council on issues of war and peace. In 1972, she was also one of the co-founders of Pax Christi-USA. She would continue to speak out against just war theory and the need for pacifism throughout the remainder of her life.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1978, she retired from her work with the CRS. Remaining active, however, she continued to work alongside the Missionaries of Charity and Co-Workers, travel abroad, and advocate for peace. In 1985, her Christopher Award-winning book, Such a Vision of the Streets was first published, detailing the life and activities of both Mother Teresa and the organizations she had founded. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In her later years, she continued to contribute stories to various Catholic publications, including Catholic Worker, to which she acted as co-editor. Her book detailing her experiences with CRS, For Whom There is No Room: Scenes from the Refugee World, was first published in 1995. After Mother Teresa's passing in 1997, Egan became an early proponent for the cause of canonization. She passed away on October 8, 2000.</p>
