            <a name="a2">Biography</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">James Cardinal Gibbons was born in Baltimore to Irish immigrants on July 23, 1834. His family returned to Ireland in 1837 and he spent a good part of his childhood there until returning with his mother and siblings in 1853 (his father having died in 1847). Gibbons would work as a grocer until 1855 when he entered St. Charles College Seminary, before moving to St. Mary's in 1857, and being ordained in 1861. Thereafter, he was a pastor at St. Bridget's and a chaplain at Fort McHenry during the American Civil War. After the war, Archbishop Spalding of Baltimore hired Gibbons as his secretary. In 1868, the Pope appointed him Apostolic Vicar of North Carolina and Titular Bishop of Adramyttium. While in North Carolina, Gibbons, now known as 'the boy bishop,' was able to write his most important work 'Faith of Our Fathers.' In 1872 he was moved to Richmond as a co-administrator before moving back to Baltimore in 1877 as co-adjuster to Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley. He became the Archbishop of Baltimore following Bayley's death on October 3, 1877.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">During his time as archbishop Gibbons had to deal with incorporating new ethnic groups within the archdiocese and host the third Plenary Council in 1884. Pope Leo XIII elevated Gibbons to Cardinal (only the second American to be so) on June 7, 1886 and he was received in Rome by the Pope on March 17, 1887. As cardinal Gibbons became the voice for American Catholics, responsible for speaking on behalf of labor groups in America, in particular the Knights of Labor. He was also instrumental in the founding of The Catholic University of America (CUA) and backing the failed 'Americanization' of the church, which was condemned by the hierarchy in Europe. Despite this setback Gibbons remained an important champion for American Catholicism.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Cardinal Gibbons was also a confidant to American Presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. His relationship with Roosevelt was the best and due to this Roosevelt was the keynote speaker at Gibbons' 1911 Jubilee for fifty years upon entering the priesthood and twenty-five years as Cardinal. Gibbons also continued to write into his elder years including his 1909 essay 'The Church and the Republic,' which was a defense of Catholicism within American society. Cardinal Gibbons died peacefully in his sleep on March 24, 1921. His impact on American Catholicism warranted many memorials to be dedicated to him, most famously the Knights of Columbus memorial commissioned by President Calvin Coolidge in 1928 and completed in 1932. Overall, Cardinal Gibbons was the national voice for American Catholics during a time of massive immigration, labor strife, and modernization.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The James Cardinal Gibbons Collection consists of two series. The first series is a box containing publications such newspapers from Cardinal Gibbons Jubilee in 1911 as well as newspapers from his death in 1921. There are also newspaper clippings which were pasted onto sheets of paper from his Jubilee and death. These articles also contain photographs of Gibbons and from his "Civic Demonstration" for his Jubilee. There are also magazines from the Baltimore Sun in tribute to Gibbons following his death in 1921. Also included are Memoriam essays written by Bishop Shahan then Rector of Catholic University. Lastly, this series contains three books; one is a 1945 biography of Gibbons, 1911 commemorative book on his Jubilee, and an October 1911 edition of "The Missionary" commemorating Gibbons' Jubilee.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series of this collection is a box of personal correspondence and publications. Gibbons' correspondence includes Photostats of all his letters in this collection as well as original copies of letters to parishioners, Pope Leo XIII, and official pastoral letters to his congregation. Also in this series are invitations and programs to Catholic University events, including a 1919 celebration Consecration celebration, with a photo album, and 1896 and 1898 commencement invitations and addresses given by Gibbons. There are also personal publications such as Apostolate letters and essays such as his 1909 "The Church and the Republic" and his 1883 "On Christian Education". Lastly, there is a pamphlet and invitation to the Rector of Catholic University for the Knights of Columbus memorial statue of Gibbons from 1932. Overall, this collection gives great insight to Cardinal Gibbons' relationship to Catholic University as well insight to his impact on American culture through the lens of his 1911 Jubilee and his death and tributes that followed.</p>
