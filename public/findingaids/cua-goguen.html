            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Joseph Henri Goguen was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, on March 8, 1899 to Olivier Goguen and Marie LeBlanc Goguen. A resident of Leominster, Massachusetts, for most of his life, he dedicated his life to public service on the city, state, and national level. He attended Assumption High School and graduated from the College of Assumption, both in Worcester, Massachusetts, and later became a teacher at the Assumption Preparatory School.  He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Holy Cross College in 1922, also in Worcester, Massachusetts.  He studied law at the Northeastern School of Law, starting in 1924, and enrolled at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1930-1931 to study French, but there is no record of him ever receiving a degree from either place. He did receive numerous honorary degrees: from Assumption College, St. Francis College, The University of Montreal, and Laval University of Quebec. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Henri Goguen embarked on his political life by becoming a local city counselor, from where he tried to springboard his career by running for Congress.  He was not elected, but managed to parlay his experience into a job as the Chief Officer of the Field Division of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  In 1939, he was appointed the United States Marshall for the District of Massachusetts, which lasted until 1947.  His political aspirations were interrupted in 1946 when he was elected President of L'Union St. Jean Baptiste de l'Amerique, one of the largest mutual benefit societies for Americans of French descent at the time.  He resigned as U.S. Marshall, ostensibly so he could devote more time to his job as President of the Society, but more likely because Franklin D. Roosevelt, of whom he was a great supporter, was no longer in office and Harry S. Truman's administration was not to his liking. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">He returned to the political arena with the Eisenhower administration, when he was named the Commissioner of Public Safety for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1952.  He briefly became acting Secretary of State in December of 1958, when the previous Secretary, Edward J. Cronin, died in office.  However, a mere two months later, a minor tax irregularity seemed to prevent him from gaining the support he would need to lose the “acting” label, and he was unable to secure a position as permanent Secretary.  In 1961, he once again returned to be full time president of L'Union St. Jean Baptiste, a duty he had somewhat neglected during his political career.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Founded in 1900, this Society started out as a prestigious club for Americans who wanted to maintain and promote their French Catholic heritage as much as possible.  The Society eventually morphed into one of the biggest mutual benefit societies of its time, supported by Catholic churches and other French societies.  The Union had close ties with several bishops and cardinals of French descent, and organized lavish banquets and “congresses” honoring various influential decision makers.  Its eventual sharp decline in membership and finances in the late 1960s and early 1970s reduced these grand feasts to regular annual conferences, and the society saw its influence gradually wane.	As president, Henri became known for his introduction of the Society's Education Foundation.  He eventually retired as president of the Society in 1974, amid failing health.  He stayed on as Chairman of the Board until he died in December of 1982.

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The first series is the "Union St. Jean Baptiste de l'Amerique, one of the largest mutual benefit societies for Americans of French descent at the time. The material in this series includes commemorative programs, invitations to banquets and other memorabilia, 1918-1981, and undated, in boxes 1-5. As mentioned above, Goguen held various offices in this society, including that of President from 1946 to 1974.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series is Political Life, 1933-1971, in box 6. This material includes correspondence, newspaper clippings, pamphlets, etc. related to his various political positions as Leominster City Counselor, U.S. Marshall for Massachusetts, Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Safety and Secretary of State. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series is Photographs, 1947-1975, and undated in boxes 6-8. This is a potentially rich series illustrating religious, social, and political life in mid twentieth century Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  Unfortunately, most of the photos are unlabeled with additional archival processing work required for better organization and accessibility. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fourth and last series is Personal material, 1913-1986, and undated, in box 8. </p>
