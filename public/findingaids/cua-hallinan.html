          <h3>
            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Born in Painesville, Ohio, on April 8, 1911, Paul J. Hallinan would become an important figure, who helped shape a variety of institutions and movements ranging from his effort to improve the Catholic academic organization known as the Newman Club, or his effort to integrate Catholic hospitals and schools during the Civil Rights Movement, to his vision - expressed most staunchly at the Second Vatican Council - of a Catholic liturgy adopting changes that would promote increased participation for the laity.  The son of Rose Jane Laracy and Clarence Cornelius Hallinan, Paul Hallinan attended St. Mary's School for middle school, followed by Cathedral Latin School for high school from 1924 to 1928, where he developed some substantial skills in writing.  He took part in the school newspaper and in the summer of 1927, he found work at a local newspaper called the Telegraph.  After being dissuaded from entering the priesthood directly after high school, Hallinan, instead, began his studies at the University of Notre Dame in 1928, where he continued his passion for journalism, being apart of numerous university-wide papers and the yearbook.  In 1932, Hallinan graduated from Notre Dame with a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and reconfirmed his desire to enter the priesthood, leading him to attend the Cleveland diocesan seminary, Our Lady of the Lake.  Only needing five of the traditional six years to complete the seminary curriculum, Hallinan was ordained by Bishop Joseph Schrembs on February 20, 1937.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Hallinan's first assignment, following his ordination, placed him at St. Aloysius Church in Cleveland as an assistant pastor.  There, he contributed greatly to youth organizations until he volunteered to be an army chaplain in 1942.  After a brief training period, Hallinan was attached to the 542nd Engineer Amphibian Regiment, which was stationed in the Pacific Ocean.  It was during his time as a military chaplain, when he engaged with members of other Christian denominations and the Jewish community, that he began to confront the issue of Ecumenism, as he found difficulty reconciling his firm beliefs with his duty to minister to non-Catholics.  Hallinan spent the majority of his time with the regiment as it went from island to island, at one point in 1944, being caught in the middle of a heavy military engagement.  In 1945, Hallinan was honorably discharged, after which he returned to the Cleveland area.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">While being assigned as a member of the clergy of St. John's Cathedral, he was also able to resume his work with young adults as he became the Newman Club chaplain at Cleveland College.  Throughout his time at Cleveland College, Hallinan grappled with the difficulty of attracting students to the organization; one of many efforts to stir interest among the student body involved the creation of a newspaper he titled the Needle.  In recognition for his hard work, in 1952 he was elected President of the National Association of Newman Club Chaplains and was soon appointed National Chaplain of the National Newman Club Federation.  Over the next six years, after being pushed onto the national stage, Hallinan spent a significant amount of time attending conferences and speaking at other universities about the value of being a Newman Club member and ways to attract new membership.  One of his main goals consisted of better organization of the Newman Club on the national level.  Despite his many responsibilities in Cleveland and with the Newman Club, Hallinan continued his educational pursuits, finding time to complete a Master's degree in History in 1953 at John Carroll University, and beginning a doctoral program in American History at Western Reserve University.  Near the end of his time with the Newman Club, however, he found it difficult to balance responsibilities and to devote sufficient time to his dissertation - a study of the life of Bishop Richard Gilmour, second bishop of Cleveland.  In fact, it would take him ten years to complete his doctoral program, in part, because of his unexpected elevation to the See of Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1958, Hallinan was informed that he was slated to become the next bishop of Charleston, South Carolina.  During his time in Charleston, he focused heavily on racial integration; after only two years, he had successfully integrated all the Catholic hospitals in his diocese and laid the ground work for the integration of the Catholic schools.  It was this type of work that steered him to take interest in the education and participation of the laity in the liturgy.  Though he was unable to fulfilling his hope of desegregating all the Catholic schools in the diocese of Charleston, before he left for his next appointment he was able to obtain the commitment of all the schools to eventually opening their doors to non-whites.  Coming as another surprise to him, he was named archbishop of Atlanta, Georgia, in 1962.  As soon as he settled into his new archbishopric, Hallinan quickly picked up where he had left off in Charleston, achieving within the year the integration of Blacks into the parochial schools of his See.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">When the Second Vatican Council was convoked by Pope John XXIII, Hallinan was voted onto the Liturgical Commission as the only American candidate.  He was also named chairman of the commission's subcommittees, which rewrote the chapter 1, "General Principles for Promoting and Reforming the Sacred Liturgy," and Chapter 8, "On the Sacraments and the Sacramentals."  His participation in the Commission for the Schema on the Sacred Liturgy heavily revolved around his advocacy for the use of vernacular in the Mass.  Hallinan urged that the use of vernacular would increase the laity's understanding and further its involvement in the liturgy.  His outspoken mentality and insistence to move through the conciliar process quickly often found him confronted by the more conservative members of the commission and the council in general.  Through his work and that of others, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy was promulgated in the second session by Pope Paul VI on December 4, 1963.  Shortly after the second session, the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL) was formed to provide all English speaking countries with a uniform English version of Liturgical changes.  Hallinan's reputation ensured that he was named vice-chairman of the newly found organization.  He was unable to be present during the third session, which convened in 1964, because he suffered severely from contracting hepatitis.  This illness would remain a chronic health concern for the remainder of his life.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Needing frequent admissions to a hospital throughout 1964, Hallinan was unable to travel from his seat in Atlanta; however, this did not prevent him from implementing the changes allowed by the council's decrees by adding vernacular into the portions of the Mass deemed acceptable.  In 1965, although still bothered by hepatitis, Hallinan returned to Rome for the last session of the council and did not settle for a passive role, delivering two speeches to the council fathers.  First, in September, he gave a speech during the debate for the Schema on Religious Liberty.  Hallinan highlighted the need to clarify the role of government in the schema, by stating that government should not promote any particular religion, while at the same time it should protect the practice of religion.  He delivered his second speech of the year in October.  True to his longtime work as a bishop, prior to the council, of racial integration in Atlanta and Charleston before that, Hallinan delivered an address to the general assembly during the debate for the Schema on the Church in the World Today.  In his speech, he appealed to the need for the Church to be more vocal about the injustice of racial discrimination.  He implored the council to state explicitly in an official document that the Church condemns slavery and its consequences; a document of this nature would help all those attempting to fight against racial injustice.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">After the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council, rather than leaving it to others to implement the changes he so strongly promoted, Hallinan spent his remaining years continuing the work and reforms he felt were so important to the Church and the world.  Although he still battled with the hepatitis that had been such an impediment to his health, he maintained an active role in the issues important to him.  He retained his position as a member of the Bishop's Committee on the Liturgy.  Through this position, he continued to promote the experimentation of vernacular use in the Mass.  As an archbishop, he pioneered experimentation of English use in his archdiocese.  His belief in the increased participation of the laity could be seen in his calling of a Lay Council, comprised of members from each parish, that met and discussed issues relevant to the upcoming diocesan synod he convened.  He also wrote a pamphlet, entitled "How to Understand Changes in the Liturgy."  After a four year struggle to overcome his illness, he was submitted to a hospital early in the year of 1968 and on March 29, 1968, Paul J. Hallinan died from acute hepatitis.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Paul J. Hallinan - Vatican Council II Collection contain the correspondence and materials he gathered as a Council Father at the Second Vatican Council.  The majority of the collection consists of his involvement in the Schema on the Sacred Liturgy as a member of the commission, as chairman of two subcommittees, Chapter 1, "General Principles for Promoting and Reforming the Sacred Liturgy," and Chapter 8, "On the Sacraments and the Sacramentals," from 1962-1963, and as a member of several post-conciliar commissions and organizations focused on the use of the vernacular in Mass.  However, there are also materials relating to other schemata of the council from 1962-1965, including the Schemata on Religious Liberty and on the Church in the World Today, and a significant amount of material directly related to the council, some produced by the Catholic Church, but some not produced by the Church, such as whole issues of newspaper and magazines, newspaper and magazine articles, press releases, and pamphlets dating from 1962-1966. The collection is divided into two series and a significant amount of the collection is written in Latin, Italian, or French.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The first series comprises the subject files of Paul J. Hallinan leading up to, during, and after his time working as a participant of the Second Vatican Council and post-conciliar groups. Correspondence, notes, newspaper and magazine articles, pamphlets, published documents, speeches, and drafts of conciliar documents are among some of the material in this series. The series contains the letter of invitation to Paul J. Hallinan to participate in the council in 1962, and an address of a protestant observer to the United States Bishops Conference, and other documents of a unique nature. There are also multiple newspaper articles and press releases concerning Hallinan's press conferences and interviews, demonstrating the level of comfort Hallinan had in the public spotlight.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The notes, newspaper and magazine articles, pamphlets, and speeches are concerned with the council and its outcomes. There is also a considerable amount of conciliar and post-conciliar documentation primarily concerned with the Schema on the Sacred Liturgy and its various chapters, including drafts of schemata and their individual chapters, commentaries, observations, voting results, and appendices.  In many cases, Hallinan wrote notes directly on these drafts, and in others he wrote his notes separately. Also in many instances, these notes identify possible suggestions for altering Church documents.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series comprises documents published between 1962 and 1966, most of which were produced by the Vatican Council as preparatory materials for those involved in the council. These materials are written in Latin and concern topics slated for debate during the council sessions. They represent general observations of the individual chapters for the Commission on the Sacred Liturgy, such as the chapter on Sacred Furnishings.  There are also drafts of other schemata either in the original Latin or translated into English.  These documents, produced between 1962 and 1965, also contain some notes in them written by Hallinan.  The rest of the materials in the second series are conciliar documents, such as published letters from the pope to the members of the attending clergy, schedules of Masses during the sessions, or member lists of each of the conciliar commissions, and secular published documents, including issues of journals.  Finally, there is a published Breviary instituted after the First Vatican Council.  These documents were published between 1962 and 1965.</p>

          <p>Found in the second series are a number of preliminary council documents meant to provide a foundation for the various topics particularly associated with the Schema on the Sacred Liturgy, although there are drafts of other schemata.  There are also a number of drafts of specific emendations to certain chapters of the Schema on the Sacred Liturgy suggested by the Council Fathers or by the Commission or its subcommissions.  The draft phases of these documents range greatly from the preliminary drafts mentioned to final ornately bound versions.  Many of these bound documents contain Hallinan's notes in the margins.  Bound copies of general addresses of the popes to the council as well as breviaries, commission rosters, Mass schedules during the council, and one 1963 copy of the 'Ecumenical Review' are also part of the series.  The majority of these documents were written in Latin, though there are a small number of English and Italian items.</p>
