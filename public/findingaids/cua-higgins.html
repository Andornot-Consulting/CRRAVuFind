          <p style="margin-left : 30pt">As much as possible, the processing attempted to reflect the filing order maintained by Higgins for reasons of provenance as well as for the use of researchers following footnotes of previously published works that used the Higgins papers. For the most part, there is a great deal of similarity in the folder titles, but the box numbers have been completely revised. Due to the large amount (in size and number) of additional accessions that arrived in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some of the information in the correspondence, subject, and writing series has changed significantly because of additions to already existing folder titles or because of the creation of new folder titles. The number of series has been reduced from 30 to 10. Those additional series were placed either in the subject or the labor series. Metal paper clips and other fasteners were removed, but most of the staples were not pulled because there was no sign of corrosion. Acid-free paper was interleaved as needed to prevent further damage to non-acidic paper.</p>

            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Monsignor George Gilmary Higgins was born in Chicago, Illinois, on January 21, 1916 to Charles Vincent Higgins and Anna Rethinger. Gaining his primary education at the St. Francis Xavier Parochial School and the Quigley Preparatory Seminary, Higgins went on to the St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in 1934, where he was ordained for the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1940. He studied at The Catholic University of America (CUA) in Washington, D.C., obtaining a Master's degree in Economics in 1942 and a Ph.D. in 1944. He served on the staff of the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC), now known as the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops (USCCB), from 1944 to 1980. Higgins himself was named Assistant Director of the department in 1946, and eventually was appointed Director in 1954, a position in which he served until 1967. He served with and was much influenced by Msgr. John A. Ryan and Fr. Raymond McGowan, both important figures in the field of Catholic social thought and labor relations. His service to the NCWC continued as the Director of the Division of Urban Affairs (Social Action Department), 1967-1972, Secretary for Research in 1972, and Secretary for Special Concerns in 1979. Higgins retired from the NCWC in 1980.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Although Higgins was ordained as a priest in the Archdiocese of Chicago, he was for all practical purposes a "Washingtonian." He lived at the NCWC/USCC staff house on the grounds of the Franciscan Monastery in Northeast Washington until he moved to Curley Hall on the campus of CUA after receiving permission from Chicago Archbishop Cody to retire in Washington. He remarked in a July 27, 1980, letter, "my 'retirement', which I foolishly thought would give me more leisure, has already proved to be nothing more than legal fiction." Higgins continued to work with the USCC as a consultant to the Department of Social Development and World Peace, and he agreed to lecture for both the School of Social Science and the Department of Theology at CUA until 1994 and serve on dissertation committees. He also continued his close association with the labor movement and wrote the weekly column "The Yardstick." </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1945, he took over the writing The Yardstick from Fr. McGowan. The Yardstick, a weekly commentary on economic, labor, and social problems, was syndicated to the Catholic press by the National Catholic Welfare Conference News Service, now Catholic News Service. In 1984 the Catholic Press Association gave him its St. Francis de Sales Award. In 1992, after writing the column weekly for 47 years, he modestly reduced the column to every other week. Higgins announced his retirement from the Yardstick in the September 2, 2001, Labor Day column, after 56 years. He was able to keep his Yardstick columns as well as his other files in order largely due to the efforts of his secretary for 27 years, Nevila McCaig. She died in 1982. He hired another secretary , Marianne Hughes,  and she remained his secretary up until his death in 2002.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Outside the NCWC, Higgins took part in numerous activities to promote Catholic social thought. He was elevated to Papal Chamberlain with the title of Monsignor in 1953, and was named a Domestic Prelate in 1959. Upon the advent of the Vatican II Council, Higgins used his experience and knowledge for the Preparatory Commission on the Lay Apostolate and as a Consultant to the Council. He attended all four sessions of the council, 1962-1965. He was on the drafting commission for its document on the laity, the first U.S. priest to receive such an appointment. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Always a champion of human rights and economic justice for all, especially farm labor where he was the moving force in the Church's support for Cesar Chavez and his union movement, Higgins served in several committees, including the Bishops' Committee for Catholic-Jewish Relations, the Bishops' Committee on Farm Labor, Chairman of the United Auto Workers Public Review Board, member of the American Arbitration Association, Executive Committee member of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, member of the Board of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Fund of the United Farm Workers, and Advisor to the Chairman of the U.S. Delegation to the Belgrade Conference on Human Rights. In addition to these activities, Higgins wrote numerous book reviews and articles for many publications, particularly Commonweal and America. On August 9, 2000, at a White House ceremony, President Bill Clinton honored Msgr. Higgins, among several other notables including Simon Wiesenthal and John Kenneth Galbraith, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Msgr. Higgins was selected because of his nearly 50 years of service to the cause of justice for workers and his widespread recognition as the "labor priest" and point man for the American Catholic Church in this regard. He was honored with the University of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal in 2001 and died on May Day, 2002, after a long illness. He was widely mourned as a tireless champion of the labor movement and a progressive voice in the Roman Catholic Church. </p>

          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">

The Higgins Papers document his life and work from the 1940s, when he was in school at The Catholic University of America (CUA), to the early 2000s when he assisted the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) with organization efforts in Catholic Hospitals. The bulk of the collection consists of paper records in the correspondence, subject files, writings, and labor series. Much of the material overlaps into other series, reflecting Higgins' activities as a labor supporter, writer, and self-described church bureaucrat.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 1 contains his correspondence as an official with the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC), later known as the United States Catholic Conference (USCC), and while he taught and lived at CUA following his retirement from the USCC. People he corresponded with were from the labor field, universities, and politics. Although some correspondence is routine, much of it provides insight into Higgins' and the other writers' thoughts on a multitude of subjects. Organizations the individuals are affiliated with are included in the folder title. Much of the general letter correspondence (A, B, C, etc.) relates to Higgins' travel, notes of condolence, and thank-you letters. The general correspondence is also rich with letters to and from different Diocesan offices, revealing issues of church-labor struggles in recognizing workers' collective bargaining rights in Catholic institutions, such as in Kansas City. Higgins also received many requests, particularly for speaking engagements and committee assignments, once he retired in 1980. Particularly interesting is the second sub-series that contain responses to the Yardstick columns Higgins received during his long career as a columnist. The third sub-series consists of interoffice correspondence from the NCWC when he served as Assistant Director and Director of the Social Action Department. Among those whom he corresponded with are NCWC general secretaries Howard Carroll, Msgr. Paul F. Tanner, and Bishop James Rausch as well as Msgr. Francis T. Hurley, Margaret Mealy, Frank Hall, Henry P. Lefebvre, and Bishop Kelly. Among the subjects covered are Catholic-Jewish relations in the late 1970s as well as national politics in general.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 2 consists of the subject files Higgins collected and his secretaries organized under a number of headings, usually by person or organization. Much of the subject files contain magazine and newspaper clippings, pamphlets, and printed material. Some of the subjects overlap, such as those dealing with the Catholic Church, popes, and encyclicals. The most numerous subject folders reflect Higgins interest in labor issues. Although there is a separate labor series, the subject files contain a substantial amount of labor information as well. Other subjects contain information on strikes and disputes in particular communities, such as Decatur, Illinois, and with particular companies, such as the Clinton Corn Company. The subject files also contain specific information on topics such as Codetermination and Socialism. Some of the subjects, such as AFL-CIO and abortion, reflect the problems Higgins faced as a clergyman in the Catholic Church and a staunch labor supporter. This issue is also documented in several folders related to Catholic hospitals. Particularly interesting is the involvement of Higgins with the SEIU to organize Catholic hospitals in the late 1990s found in the Health Care-Labor folder. The subject files also contain significant documentation of farm workers and illegal immigrants under such folder headings as "Illegal Aliens," "Illegals," and "Migratory Labor." During processing, attempts were made to keep the same alphabetical arrangement that had been maintained by Higgins. However, the large amount of addenda required some new subject folders to be created, as well as some extraneous series, such as "Spanish Unions" to be arranged along with the existing subject files.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 3 contains labor files reflecting some of Higgins' most intense efforts on behalf of unions and union organizers. Some of this material overlaps with the subject files series, particularly farm labor issues and his association with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). However, the bulk of the material related specifically to the farm labor struggle of the 1970s can be found in the farm labor sub-series. The Labor Day files, UAW Public Review Board files, teachers' union files, and the J. P. Stevens files are, for the most part, exclusive to this series. Specific correspondence to each sub-series was kept, though there is some overlap with the correspondence section. The Farm Labor sub-series, for example, contains all of his correspondence with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers (UFW), and others that he knew primarily through the cause. Overlap with the correspondence series was avoided, for the most part, but also inevitable due to the myriad interlocking relationships and issues involving him.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 3.1 consists of correspondence that Higgins kept with labor organizations and unions. This sub-series is rich with correspondence with the AFL-CIO, the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice, the SEIU, and a wide variety of specific unions from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers to the Upholsterer's International Union.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Subseries 3.2, the farm labor files, documents Higgins' work with the USCC Ad Hoc Committee on Farm Labor, Cesar Chavez, and the United Farm Workers (UFW). The files reflect his growing interest in the organizational efforts of farm workers in California in the 1960s. As a result of Higgins intense lobbying efforts, the USCC formed the Ad Hoc Committee on Farm Labor to help mediate negotiations between the largely Catholic farm owners and workers. The files document this involvement thoroughly during 1970-1975 as he corresponded with others on the committee, such as Joseph F. Donnelly, and received updates from Roger Mahony. The Mahony Files are a particularly valuable source of daily newspapers clippings from newspapers throughout the disputed areas. The Farm Labor Releases consists mostly of National Catholic News Service, but other sources appear as well such as the USCC, Victor Riesel's Inside Labor, and press release from the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO. There is also significant correspondence with Chavez and the United Farm Workers (UFW). Other important files contain correspondence and subjects files from the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), the Texas Farm Workers Union, and the Martin Luther King Farm Workers Fund.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Subseries 3.3, the UAW Public Review Board files, consists almost entirely of decisions and cases Higgins heard as chairman and member of the board from its inception until he retired in 2000 after serving as the chairman since 1966. He corresponded with both PRB members and UAW officials such as Water E. Oberer, Morris Adler, Walter Reuther, and David Y. Klein. Many of the decisions and cases involve promotion, termination, and discipline disputes, although some of the early cases involve Communist Party affiliations. The PRB files reflect the efforts of the UAW to monitor itself as a result of outside political scrutiny of labor activities. As a result of the nature of the files, some may be considered confidential.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 3.4, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) files, contains correspondence and subject files reflecting Higgins' association with the ILO and workers' unions abroad. He corresponded with ILO D.C. branch head Ralph Wright, David a. Morse, the ILO Director-General, James P. Mitchell of the Department of Labor, and Joseph N. Joblin. The news releases include Yardstick and National Catholic News Service about the ILO, and the speeches and statements include Higgins' addresses at ILO meetings and his testimonies before the U.S. Congress. Information on European unions includes news releases, publications, and memos on Christian trade unions and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 3.5 contains files from the J.P. Stevens Company strike and labor dispute in North Carolina. The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), along with the AFL-CIO, organized a boycott and media campaign against the company because the company refused to sign a contract after recognizing the union following a 1974 election to allow union representation at seven J.P. Stevens plants in North Carolina. Although Higgins was not directly involved, he was sent correspondence, clippings, and printed material from Patrick Sullivan, the ACTWU clergy representative. In 1980, the ACTWU signed a contract with J.P. Stevens Company ending the boycott.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 3.6, the Labor Day files, contains drafts, copies, correspondence, and subject files related to the NCWC (and later the USCC) Labor Day statements. The NCWC issued these statements in conjunction with the American Labor Day Holiday, and Higgins either wrote or consulted on nearly every statement from his time as Director of the Social Action Department in 1955 until his retirement in 1980. The information in the folders reveal the issues surrounding the Catholic Church's support for collective bargaining and workers' rights while at the same time attempting to remain politically neutral. The post-1980 material includes non-Higgins Labor Day statements from the USCC. However, he continued to travel nationwide to Labor Day events and celebrations in 1980s and 1990s, and his statements at these events are included. Some of this speech material may overlap with material found in the writings series.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 3.7 contains files on Right-to-Work laws enacted largely in southern states following World War II. The laws restricted organizing efforts and collective bargaining under a title that Higgins and others considered misleading. He corresponded on the issue with Leon A. McNeill, John F. Cronin, John W. Miller, Edward Cardinal Mooney, and Francis Comey.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 3.8, the Teachers' Union files, contains documents on the organization efforts of parochial school teachers in the 1970s. As with the J.P. Stevens Company boycott, Higgins remained largely on the sidelines but still offering advice and keeping informed of developments. His involvement was also limited due to the fact that many teachers worked in Catholic schools, and while Higgins supported their collective bargaining efforts, he could not fight as aggressively because of his USCC employment status, which was increasingly in peril in the late 1970s. The files contain correspondence with Thomas C. Kelly of the USCC and John Krol, the archbishop of Philadelphia. Other files contain National Catholic News Service coverage and court documents related to organizing efforts. He also received correspondence and other materials from the Association of Catholic Teachers and the Federation of Catholic Teachers.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 4, The Jewish Files, contains speeches, statements, news releases, correspondence, articles, and pamphlets reflecting Higgins involvement with Catholic-Jewish Relations. Although his interest in Catholic-Jewish Relations began with his involvement with Jewish Labor leaders, his work on the issue at the Vatican II Council led to his increased involvement as an original member of the international Catholic-Jewish dialogue. Over the course of Higgins work on the issue, he corresponded with both Jewish and Catholic leaders and organizations, such as the NCCB Secretariat for Catholic-Jewish Relations, the Seton Hall Institute of Judeo-Christian Studies, the Anti-Defamation League, Synagogue Council of America, Pio Laghi, American Jewish Committee, Marc Tannenbaum, Archbishop John J. Krol, and Leon Klenicki. As with other series, the correspondence in this series overlaps with the correspondence in series one. The files on Malachi Martin are included in this series because of his involvement with the changes in the Catholic Church's stance on Judaism during the Vatican II Council. Martin went on to request his release from his vows as a Jesuit and became a critic of the Church through his numerous writings in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 5, the Events series, contains information on Higgins' trips abroad for religious, labor, and diplomatic efforts. Much of the series consists of subject files about the trips, although there is some correspondence concerning logistics, updates, and letter thanking hosts. The files are organized alphabetically by event and most of the information is exclusive to this series. The Belgrade Conference on Human Rights occurred from October 4, 1977 to March 9, 1978, and the purpose was to further discuss the documents created during the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). He was selected to attend as a representative of the United States, and the folders contain correspondence with government officials, such as Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg. The Belgrade Conference files also contain news releases, clippings, and statements. The Far East folders largely contain correspondence about his travels and meetings with religious and labor leaders in Asian countries that included the Philippines and South Korea in the early 1980s. Some of this correspondence overlaps with individual correspondence in series one. The information found in the Saint Stephen's Crown folders concerns the return of the crown in 1978 by a delegation from the United States that included Higgins as well as Geno Baroni and George Mitchell. The crown ended up in the hands of the United States during World War II. Of particular interest is a letter from Higgins to Bishop Kelly, the head of the USCC/NCCB, that describes Higgins trip and meeting with the Archbishop of Hungary. The Synod folders contain information on Higgins' participation in the Synod of Bishops in 1969 and 1971. The 1969 Synod was called to discuss the use and abuse of authority in the Church while the 1971 Synod concentrated principally on the problems of the priesthood. Much of the content of the Synod Bishops 1971 folders consists of National Catholic News releases about the event. The Vatican II files contain information compiled by Higgins during his time at the council from 1962-1965. The material is in Latin, Italian, and French as well as English, and consists of documents and statements with little correspondence. The Vatican II documents were previously housed in two boxes labeled "Commissio Praeparatoria de Apotolatu Laicorum" and "NCWC Rome Office English Translations, 1962-1965."</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 6, the Writings series, contains three sub-series: Yardstick Chronological, Yardstick Subject, and Articles, Speeches, and Sermons. Although copies of Higgins' writings, particularly his Yardstick columns, can be found in other series, the Writings series contains the bulk of that material, including numerous drafts and edited copies.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 6.1, The Yardstick Chronological files, contains nearly every copy of Higgins' Yardstick columns beginning in 1945 until 2001. Most of the earlier columns contain only the final National Catholic News Service copies sent out to Catholic newspaper editors across the country. However, more of the source material, drafts, and copies of the published columns begin to appear in later years. By the 1990s, perhaps due to way the Yardstick is distributed, there are fewer final NC News copies and more of the draft copies. An index from 1945 to 1994 is available in the John J. O'Brien book "George G. Higgins and the Quest for Worker Justice." The Yardstick Chronological files also contain pre-1945 Yardstick columns written by Raymond McGowan. There are also Yardstick columns written by guest writers who substituted for Higgins when he was traveling, particularly during his time at Vatican II from 1962 to 1965.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Subseries 6.2, the Yardstick Subject files, contains his Yardstick columns organized alphabetically by subject with related correspondence and clippings included in some of the folders. This filing system was most likely maintained by Higgins' secretary Nevila McCaig, so there is a noticeable lack of subject files after 1982, the year McCaig died. The Yardstick subject files cover many of the same topics as the subject files, but during processing, unlike the subject files, no more material was added to the Yardstick subject files. However, original correspondence was removed and replaced with acid-free photocopies. This was done to include that correspondence with the main correspondence series. There are also folders, such as J.P. Stevens Co., that also cover area in other series of the collection. So, the Yardstick subject files are a good supplement to other material in the collection as well as providing some coverage of subjects not found in other parts of the collection, for instance the John Birch Society.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Subseries 6.3, Articles, Sermons, and Speeches, covers the rest of Higgins numerous writing efforts outside of his Yardstick columns. He wrote articles and book reviews for magazines like Commonweal and America and wrote speeches and sermons for labor events, funerals, and award ceremonies. Some of the articles and book reviews include related correspondence with editors. The A-Z arrangement of the book reviews refers to the last name of the author of the book he reviewed. Many of the speeches were removed from black binders that also contained indexes. These are included in the beginning of the related folders, although the later speeches in the 1980s and 1990s do not include these indexes. The speeches are in various formats such as addresses, drafts, sermons, and radio and television broadcasts. The topics include labor, theology, and politics, and there are some speeches that he prepared for other including Washington, D.C. Archbishop O'Boyle. Some of the speeches have attachments with clippings that report on the speeches. The "Duplicates" folders obviously include but duplicate speeches, but also revisions of speeches and others not found in the indexed folders. The sermons are filed under several names including invocations and eulogies. Higgins also maintained files on other invocations he did not write; however some of the files in "Invocations (not Higgins)" also include some correspondence between he and others concerning speaking engagements and requests of invocation copies from other priests.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 7, Personal, consists mostly of correspondence and clippings that documents, among other things, Higgins' life as a student in the 1940s, his relationship with his parents from the 1940s to the 1960s, and the news coverage of his speeches, writings, and awards. The first sub-series contains all of the documentation kept by him while the other two sub-series contain files from the authors of two books on his life. Although the material in both of the book file sub-series contain material obtained from Higgins, the sub-series also contain important notes and other documents that were created by the authors, George Costello and William Boles. The first sub-series contains many folders with biographical and genealogical files, largely composed of clippings about Higgins, program booklets from event in which he spoke and was honored, and copies of articles he wrote. The general correspondence contains many letters from his family, particularly his parents Anna and Charles, as well thank-you and congratulatory notes and cards from many of his friends in the Catholic and labor communities. The correspondence between Higgins and his parents is particularly rich and contains his' private insights into his role as a labor priest and writer. Other folders contain medical and financial documents and correspondence. Much of the information in the medical folders deals with his various ailments in the early 1990s. There are two sections of folders that contain information on his retirement. One section, the early retirement folders, document the forced retirement attempted by the USCC in 1978, an attempt that was loudly protested by many from both the Catholic and labor communities. The USCC relented and allowed him to stay on until 1980 when he turned 65 and reached the mandatory retirement age. The second folder of retirement correspondence and clippings contains information about this "second" retirement in 1980. The students files contain documents from Higgins time as a seminary student at Mundelein in Illinois and his time as a masters and doctoral student at The Catholic University of America. The student files from CUA are particularly interesting because the files document his studies in labor relations, economics, and labor history. This course of study reflects the interest of many priests at the time to use Catholic social justice to promote better labor-management relations and, as a result, better conditions for workers. The first book files sub-series contains information on the book "Without Fear or Favor" by George Costello. Although some of the material duplicates documents found in other series in the collection, the interviews are particularly notable. Costello interviewed such figures as Arthur Goldberg as well as Nevila McCaig, Higgins' secretary for 27 years (she died shortly after the interview in 1982). The other book files sub-series contains notes as well as some interviews completed by William Bole over the course of his completion of Organized Labor and the Church." Although Higgins was a co-author on this book, Bole largely undertook the organization of it and the addition of supplementary material.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 8, contains publications that span from Higgins time as a seminary student in the 1930s to 2002, the year that he died. As in other series in the collection, the publications reflect Higgins' interest in organized labor, the Catholic Church, and Catholic-Jewish relations. The first 14 boxes contain many books that Higgins that he discussed in his Yardstick columns and reviewed for the Catholic News Service, Commonweal, and America among others. Many of the books contain notations made by Higgins. Other books reflect his interest in Catholic thought by other theologians and Catholic thinkers such as Joseph Bernardin, Charles Curran, Michael Harrington, Michael Novak, and Richard Neuhaus. Other publications include meeting proceedings and official publications from government and religious organizations including the United States government and the USCCB. Some early publications of interest are from the Summer School of Social Action for Priests held in 1938. The 14 boxes of books are generally arranged alphabetically by author and title. The final six boxes contain non-book printed materials and are arranged chronologically.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 9, the audio/visual material, consists of photographs, cassette tapes, reels, and VHS tapes representing the broad spectrum of George Higgins' life, from his boyhood days attending the St. Francis Xavier Parochial School, his active life as labor priest throughout the 20th century, and culminating with his Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2000. Some of the more notable photographs in the collection include pictures of Msgr. Higgins with Popes Paul VI and John Paul II. There are also some very great photographs of a young George Higgins from childhood through his ordination. Some notable political figures that appear in the photo series are Eleanor Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Al Gore, Walter Mondale, and Hillary Clinton. There is a very rich collection of 8x10, black and white photographs of Cesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Series 10 consists of memorabilia and oversize material housed in a variety of boxes and spanning from 1942 to 2001. These items, often framed or bound, include personal items like his family coat of arms, earned degrees such as his 1942 masters and 1944 doctoral diplomas from .The Catholic University of America (CUA), numerous honorary degrees from institutions such as Loyola University of Chicago and Seton Hall University, commemorative papal coins, pens used by President Johnson to sign social welfare legislation into law, a certificate of appreciation from the U.S. Labor Department's Labor Hall of Fame, a key to the city of El Paso, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and numerous other awards and honors in the form of plaques, statues, coins, posters, paper weights, and framed resolutions.

				1947-2001, Boxes 1-73</font>
          </h3>
          <p>Series 1 contains Higgins' correspondence as an official with the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC), later known as the United States Catholic Conference (USCC),  and while he taught and lived at The Catholic University of America (CUA) following his retirement from the USCC. He corresponded with a variety of people in general but with a focus on those in the labor field, educational institutions, and politics. Although some correspondence is routine, much of it provides insight into his and the other writers' thoughts on a multitude of subjects. Organizations that the individuals were affiliated with are included in the folder titles. The first sub-series contains the bulk of his correspondence. The second sub-series consists of letters he got in response to the numerous newspaper columns he wrote. The third sub-series contains his interoffice correspondence from within the NCWC. Some correspondence can also be found in the Labor Series and the Personal series. Most notably, a large bulk of Farm Labor correspondence (including correspondence with Cesar Chavez), is located in the Labor series. </p>

          <p>The second series consists of the subject files Higgins collected and his secretaries organized under a number of subject headings, usually by person or organization. Although many of the subject files contain magazine and newspaper clippings, pamphlets and printed material, there is also a substantial amount of correspondence. Some of the subjects overlap, such as those dealing with the Catholic Church, popes, and encyclicals. The most numerous subject folders reflect Higgins' interest in labor issues.</p>

          <p>The third series contains labor files reflecting some of Higgins' most intense efforts on behalf of unions and union organizers. Some of this material overlaps with the subject files series, particularly farm labor issues and Higgins' association with the International Labor Organization. However, the bulk of the material related specifically to the farm labor struggle of the 1970s can be found in the farm labor sub-series. The Labor Day files, UAW Public Review Board files, teachers' union files, and the J. P. Stevens files are, for the most part, exclusive to this series.</p>

          <p>The Jewish Files in the fourth series contain speeches, statements, news releases, correspondence, articles, and pamphlets reflecting Higgins involvement with Catholic-Jewish Relations. Although his interest in Catholic-Jewish Relations began with his involvement with Jewish Labor leaders, his work on the issue at the Vatican II Council led to his increased involvement as an original member of the international Catholic-Jewish dialogue. </p>

          <p>This series contains publications that span from Higgins' time as a seminary student in the 1930s to 2002, the year that he died. As in other series in the collection, the publications reflect his interest in organized labor, the Catholic Church, and Catholic-Jewish relations. The first 14 boxes contain many books that Higgins discussed in his Yardstick columns and reviewed for the Catholic News Service (CNS), Commonweal, and America among others. Many of the books contain notations made by Higgins. The 14 boxes of books are generally arranged alphabetically by author and title. The final six boxes contain non-book printed materials and are arranged chronologically .</p>
