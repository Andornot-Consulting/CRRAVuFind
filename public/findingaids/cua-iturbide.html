            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Agustin Iturbide III, grandson of Emperor Iturbide I, was born in Mexico City during the French occupation of the country in 1863. Desiring a Mexican heir, Emperor Maximilian I, an Austrian by birth, arranged to adopt Iturbide III, then two years old, in 1865. Following the collapse of Maximilian's regime in 1867, Agustin was reunited with his birth parents in Havana, and resided with his mother in the United States until 1875 before leaving to study in Brussels. Agustin remained in Europe for many years before returning once again to attend graduate school in Washington, DC. He was awarded a master's degree in Linguistics from Georgetown University in 1884. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Iturbide returned to Mexico in 1887 to enter the Military Academy in Chapultepec. Although he had aspirations for a storied military career, his outspoken nature was ultimately self-sabotaging. Indeed, his criticisms of the Diaz regime in both a New York newspaper and in personal correspondence resulted in his being court-martialed in 1890. Convicted of insubordination, he was sentenced to one year in prison and was subsequently exiled.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Financially ruined, and grieving for his mother, who passed away during attempts to salvage the family fortune, Iturbide moved to Rosedale to teach Spanish and French at Georgetown University. It was there, however, that he met Louise Kearney, who would become his wife in 1915. The Kearneys were a prominent Washington family that emigrated from Ireland in the late 1700s. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Agustin Iturbide III continued to teach until his death from Tuberculosis in 1925. Louise Kearney lived the rest of her life in a small P Street apartment and became friends with Catholic University procurator Msgr. James Magner, to whom she entrusted this collection in 1957.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Iturbide-Kearney Family collection consists of seven series. These contain personal information on both families such as correspondence, personal portraits, and official government documents. There are publications on the Iturbide family and their contributions to Mexican independence, as well as personal scrapbooks of Agustin Iturbide III. Finally are the personal papers of Louise Kearney, including correspondence after her husband's death in 1925.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series one is personal and governmental documents from Agustin Iturbide I, including his diary (dated 1787 to 1793), correspondence during the independence movement (1813 to 1821), and governmental documents from his time as Emperor. In addition, there are three photocopies of documents related to what is often called the Mexican Declaration of Independence, or "El Plan de Iguala". This series is entirely in Spanish.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series two is comprised of the family correspondence of Iturbide III from 1849 to 1924. Most of these letters pertain both to his time with Emperor Maximilian and his life post-exile, although some do touch upon his court-martial in 1890. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series three is fairly short and contains but three folders on Mexican politics during the 1870s, including a Mexican political cartoon board game.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series four contains correspondence and legal documents pertaining to Agustin Iturbide III's largely unsuccessful real estate deals from 1905 to 1921. There are also legal proceedings relating to a California lawyer William H. Holcomb, and to Agustin Iturbide III's attempts at reclaiming land in Mexico after the fall of the Diaz regime.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Series five, Publications, includes collected articles, magazines, and books on the Iturbide family's contribution to Mexican independence.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Series six is the Kearney family papers, and includes correspondence from the first member of the Kearney family to immigrate to the United States, as well as the personal papers of Louise Kearney, including her handwritten autobiography, general correspondence, and her correspondence with Magner regarding donation of the collection to Catholic University.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series seven, Photos, Portraits, and Scrapbooks, contains family portraits, coat of arms, and personal photos of Agustin Iturbide III and Louise Kearney. Also included are family documents and newspaper clippings pertaining to both Iturbide's time with Maximilian I and to his eventual court-martial.</p>
