            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">William K. Leahy was born May 27, 1935 in Philadelphia to John and Geraldine Leahy. Bill, as he was affectionately known, was a deeply religious man and devout Catholic at the time he, while still a high school sophomore, entered St. Charles Seminary in 1951. A brilliant student, Leahy, shortly after graduating from the seminary, was sent to study scripture in Rome, where he was ordained in 1959. Leahy had a personal meeting with Pope John XXIII about the study of scripture and was given warning about straying from Church doctrine.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">For the next three years, Leahy worked as a translator for the American Secretariat for the Council. Shortly before the Council was held, he earned his doctorate from the Dominican University in Theology. At the Council, his ability to transcribe the daily Council speeches from Latin to English by the close of the day earned him recognition as a brilliant translator. The Council also inspired Leahy's idealism and so he became a dedicated believer in the liberal cause of the Church both during and after the Council. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The end of the Council was only the beginning for Leahy, who developed a working relationship with other progressive theologians. In 1965, he was assigned to St. Charles Seminary in Philadelphia, yet he was fired in 1966 for teaching his progressive beliefs, which included his support for a married clergy and contraception. He remained a priest and after a few other small assignments, he was defrocked from the priesthood.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Leahy's life thereafter was consumed by his alcoholism until he overcame it in 1975. Shortly after this time, he began reaching out to the poor and the underprivileged. His first position was as a high-level administrator at a hospital that he soon quit so he could work directly with the poor. He spent the last years of his life reaching out and ministering to the homeless, addicts, people with AIDS, and gays and lesbians. He was also involved in several progressive organizations such as the Federation of Christian Ministers, where he served a term as president. He also served as president of CORPUS, an organization that advocated for married priests. Lastly, he was active in the organization of Call to Action, which called for renewal and was made up of excommunicated Catholics.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">A monumental part of Leahy's later life was the adoption of son David, whom he took in while still teaching at St. Charles Seminary. William K. Leahy remained in Philadelphia until his death following a minor illness on January 9, 1999.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The William K. Leahy Papers consist of seven series. The first series contains Latin copies of speeches made by the bishops at the Second Vatican Council. Most of these speeches include English translation notes that Leahy made before making full English translations of all Council speeches. Also included in this series are his personal notebooks and journals from the Council. The second series contains written English statements from the Bishops of the Council. Most of these also include personal notes made by Leahy on the doctrine that the Bishops were discussing in their statements. There are also multiple copies of released statements; the original statements include notes Leahy's notes made on the document.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series contains English news releases from the council. Most of these news releases were made from Leahy's translations of the Council speeches. These news releases are titled as "Council Digest" and include releases for the American delegation. There are also news releases included, in English, published for the members of the Council. The fourth series is a two-box collection of Latin Council pamphlets that Leahy collected. Most of these pamphlets are doctrinal statements that were released by the Council.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fifth series is a collection of Italian and French newspapers concerning the events of the Council. Most of the French newspapers discuss the French delegation during the Council, as well as French Church politics. The Italian newspapers, all copies from the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, discuss Council politics and news from the papacies of John XXIII and Paul VI. The sixth series includes American newspapers concerning the council and the Papacy. There is also a large collection of The National Catholic Reporter, which includes social issues from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These issues include contraception, married priests, and the peace movement during the Vietnam War. The seventh series contains the contents of a scrapbook made by Leahy's sister upon his death. The scrapbook includes personal photos from his time in Rome, photos of his family, newspaper clippings, and his eulogy.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Lastly, the eighth series is a collection of Leahy's periodicals and personal books. The periodicals included in this collection are copies of Time and Newsweek discussing the council and the Papacies of John XXIII and Paul VI. The other set of periodicals are copies of America Magazine, which discusses various social justice issues of the mid-1960s. The books in this series includes four books on the Council, one of them of English translations of all speeches given at the council that was written by Leahy, and a Latin to English dictionary. Overall, these papers contain a rich collection of speeches and statements released from the Council, as well as publications about the Council and various activist movements of the 1960s.</p>
