            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Aloysius Domenico Ligutti, known as Luigi, was born on March 21, 1895 in Romans, Italy to Spiridione and Teresa Ariani Ligutti.  After the death of his father when he was 17, he and his mother immigrated to Des Moines, Iowa to join his elder sister and her family there.  Before immigrating to America, Luigi had been preparing for ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood.  He arrived in Iowa determined to continue his studies, and to this aim entered St. Ambrose College in Davenport, all the while learning to speak and write English.  He graduated from St. Ambrose on June 10, 1914 and that fall began a three year sequence of study at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore.  He was ordained at 22 years of age on September 22, 1917, becoming the youngest priest in the United States of America.  He continued his studies at the Catholic University of America in the Department of Greek and Latin and received a Master of Arts degree in June, 1918. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">While Ligutti had hoped to continue on and receive a Doctorate in Classics, a shortage of priests in Iowa necessitated his return there for pastoral work.  For two years he served as a Latin teacher, the registrar, and librarian for the newly created and diocesan run Des Moines Academy, before being appointed as the pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Woodbine and its mission church St. Brigid of Erin in Magnolia.  It was at Sacred Heart that Liguitti began to develop what would become his life long concern over the problems of rural life, in all their manifestations.  He stated simply, "I was interested in the problems of rural life because my people were farmers."  By 1926 he had been transferred to Assumption Parish in Granger, Iowa.  While working with his parishioners, many of whom lived below the poverty level, Ligutti's sensitivity to their needs, both basic needs for the support of human life and their needs as Catholics, continued to grow.  In 1933 he applied for a loan from the Federal Subsistence Homsteads Division, one of the New Deal programs. With these funds he settled fifty families, who could normally depend only on income from seasonal mining work, on subsistence-size plots; within two years these families were off federal relief.  The Granger Homsteads were so successful that Eleanor Roosevelt visited to inspect the New Deal project.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Ligutti had also become an active member in the National Catholic Rural Life Conference; in 1937 he became the president of the NCRLC, and on January 1, 1941 he resigned as pastor of Granger to become the full-time executive director.  In this position, Ligutti effectively used the press, radio, congressional hearings, and the public platform at large to bring his message - "Christ to the Country, and the Country to Christ" - to America's rural farmers. His work in the rural areas brought him in contact with like-minded Protestants, and together with members of the Jewish community, the first ecumenical statement in the United States, "Man's Relation to the Land," was signed.  Due to Ligutti's success, both in bringing to light the plight of the Catholic farmer and in improving his life, the apostolic delegate from the Holy See asked him to go to Italy and study the problem of rural life after World War II.  His work on the rural life problem expanded to include the problem of displaced persons and emigration.  In 1948 he was appointed as the Vatican observer to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO).  From 1950 to 1967 he was heavily involved in nine international rural life conferences, and in 1962 oversaw the formation of the International Catholic Rural Association.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">His international profile brought him into contact with the highest members of the Catholic hierarchy and had a great influence on how the Vatican dealt with the problems of rural life all over the world.  On November 21, 1960, Ligutti was appointed as a consultant to the Second Vatican Council's preparatory commission on the Apostolate of the Laity, becoming a member of the subcommittee on social action.  On October 31, 1962, he was named as peritus for the council, but he always insisted that the most important work he did was behind the scenes, spreading information about rural life among the thousands of Catholic leaders present and serving the missionary priests and bishops who were unfamiliar with Vatican protocol.  Because of this self-appointed role, in October 1963 he was officially appointed as assistant director of the lay auditors of the council, in order to provide them with practical assistance and to facilitate their full participation in the council.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Ligutti believed it imperative that the council pronounce on three topics: the social teaching of the church applied to the social needs of all mankind, the need for a clear-cut statement on stewardship in the church, and the need to to establish a secretariat for justice in order to fight world-wide poverty.  On this last aim he worked with James J. Norris and Msgr. Joseph Gremillion in creating the Secretariat for Promoting World Justice and Development and the Commission for Justice and Peace, on which Liguitti served as a consultant for five years.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1960, Ligutti ceased to be the executive director of the NCRLC, after the special position of director of international affairs was created, allowing him to continue his international work on behalf of rural Catholics.  In 1970 he moved to Rome and a year later founded "Agrimissio," an organization dedicated to helping Catholic organizations promote agricultural research and agricultural development in mission areas.  He served as the first chairman of its board of directors until 1981.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1983, Luigi Ligutti died in Rome after a brief illness.  As per his request, he was buried with his former parishioners in Granger, Iowa.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The majority of the collection reflects Ligutti's work with the preparatory commission on the Apostolate of the Laity and his work as a peritus for the commission on Schema XIII: The Church in the Modern World.  The collection primarily consists of mostly undated documents produced by the preparatory commission and undated and emended drafts of Schema XIII, a few of which include Ligutti's handwritten observations.  While Schema XIII is present in its entirety throughout the collection, the sections most heavily represented are those that dealt with Liguitti's life-long concerns: marriage and family life, social action, and the pastoral care of the clergy for the laity. The collection also includes some correspondence, published versions of some Vatican II Council decrees, topically related articles and publications not directly produced by the Council press, and press releases put out by the National Catholic Welfare Conference during the Council. Two other items of interest are the visitor's book, biginning in 1962, of the N.C.W.C's Rome Office, and a photograph of a Vatican Commission.</p>
