            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Dr. Richard Robert Madden, M.D. was born in Dublin on August 20 1798. Madden had a stellar education at the finest private schools where his passion for medicine began. He worked as an apprentice for Dr. Woods of Athboy for five years before traveling to Paris, London, and Naples to continue his career. In 1824, Madden went to the Near East for three years, where he studied the ancient burial practices of the local people. Until 1833, Madden lived in London, where he continued his work on burial studies. That year he was appointed as a special magistrate in Jamaica, where he was in charge of carrying out the abolition of slavery. Due to the resistance of the planters, Madden he resigned his position in 1834. He was a magistrate in Havana from 1836-1840, and in Africa from 1841-1843. Dr. Madden also served three years in Lisbon, Portugal as a reporter for the Morning Chronicle.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1846, Madden was appointed as colonial secretary of Western Australia, where he took up the humanitarian cause of improving the lives of the aborigines. His last governmental position was his job of thirty years (from 1850 to 1880) as secretary of the Loan Fund Board of Dublin. Dr. Madden's work as a historian and his ability as a writer for different social causes are among his significant professional achievements. One of his most important works was his seven volumes of "The United Irishman, their lives and times" (1843-1846); his other important works of Irish history include "Connection of the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of England" (1845), and "Penal Laws Enacted against Roman Catholics" (1845).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The other major topics Madden wrote about were the evils of slavery and the burial practices of ancient and modern times. Most of Madden's writings on slavery came from his work as a colonial administrator in the Caribbean. His most famous work on this topic was his two volumes of "Travels to the West Indies" (1838-1840) and "The Slave Trade and Slavery" (1843). His work on various burial practices was all published in his 1851 book, Shrines and Sepulchers of the Old and New World. Robert R. Madden would remain in Dublin until his death at the age of 87 on February 5, 1886.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Robert Richard Madden Papers consists of two series. The first series is personal papers and manuscripts. The manuscripts are a collection of papers of Dr. Madden that were bound in two volumes. These two volumes have a wide variety of topics in which Madden was interested. They include obituaries from the 1870's of local Dubliners, names and references to books. Shakespeare excerpts, articles on different Irish scholars, political articles, and tributes. This collection also includes a book of poetry and a book an ancient Irish burials with hand-drawn images and diagrams. Lastly, this collection consists of newspaper clippings from famous burials, notes to scholars on burial practices, and a book of testimonials on Madden's work in the anti-slavery movement. The second series has several hand-written chapters of Madden's 1851 book Shrines and Sepulchers. These notes were taken after the publication around 1872-1873.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Madden papers mainly focus on his work researching ancient burial grounds, although there is a cursory amount of information on his work as a colonial administrator and anti-slavery activist. The papers on burial practices are extensive on the history of the burial, as well as the religious ceremonies accompanying the funeral. Madden also uses secondary sources, which one can find pasted in his journals with personal annotations. Madden's close attention to history gives a good insight into English and Irish history from the ancient period until the mid-nineteenth century. Lastly, Madden's personal papers reveal a scholar's opinion on Irish politics and British policy in Ireland in the second half of the nineteenth century. Overall, the Robert Richard Madden papers give great insight to one of the most important Irish scholars of his generation.</p>
