            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">William Joseph McDonald was born on June 15, 1904 in Ireland. He spent most of his early life there and studied at Kieran's College and Seminary where he was ordained as a priest in 1928. Shortly afterwards he immigrated to the United States, to San Francisco where he became an Assistant Pastor and an administrator for the Archdiocese. He was also a chaplain for the Newman Club at Stanford University and an associate editor for the Archdiocesan newspaper, "The Monitor". His career at The Catholic University of America (CUA) began in 1936 when he came to pursue his graduate studies in Philosophy. He would earn a masters degree the following year and a Ph.D. in 1939; afterwards in 1940 he became an instructor in the CUA School of Philosophy.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">McDonald's academic career advanced throughout the next fourteen years when he was made an assistant professor in 1944, full professor in 1950, and, due to his perceived skills within the School of Philosophy, was made Vice Rector in 1954. The following year he was also made director of Ecclesiastical Schools. In 1957 he succeeded Bishop McEntegart as acting rector, becoming rector in his own right in 1958. His inauguration was on April 16, 1958 and was attended by the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, Amleto Giovanni Cardinal Cicogani. McDonald's time as rector was known for a massive rise in the numbers of undergraduate students and the construction of many new buildings. He was also appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Washington in 1964.
His rectorship ended in 1967 amidst the turmoil of the campus unrest of the 1960s. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Following his tenure as CUA rector, he was made Auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco, retiring in 1979. His other accomplishments include inaugurating the first nationwide religious television show in 1952, editor in chief of "The New Catholic Encyclopedia", and served as President of the Federation of Catholic Universities. During the Second Vatican Council he was named Peritus. His final accomplishment was being awarded The President's Centennial Medal in 1988 by then CUA president Rev. William J. Byron, SJ. Bishop McDonald died in San Francisco at the age of 84 on January 7, 1989.

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The William Joseph McDonald Papers consists of one series of personal publications, materials from his inauguration as Rector of Catholic University in 1958, and his consecration as Auxiliary Bishop of Washington D.C. in 1964. The publications are arranged in chronological order of publication date and include multiple copies. The publications range from 1945 to 1962; topics including Communism, Celtic Philosophy, and Jesuits within Catholic Education. The materials from McDonald's inauguration include an original program and a published book from 1959 with pictures addresses by members of the clergy and the inaugural address. The materials from the consecration include multiple copies of the program, menu to the banquet, and a listing of the attendees to the mass and banquet following. Lastly, there are two letters; one describing the President's Centennial Medal awarded to McDonald and the other being his university obituary. Overall, this is a great collection for research on Catholic University history as well as philosophical research on Celtic Philosophy and the dangers of Communism.</p>
