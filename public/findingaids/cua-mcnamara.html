            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Reverend Robert Francis McNamara was born on November 3, 1910 to Thomas A. McNamara and Helen Dwyer McNamara in Corning, New York.  After receiving a BA degree from Georgetown University in 1932 and an MA degree from Harvard University in 1933, he graduated from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1937, with the degree of Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL).  He is also a graduate of the Pontifical North American College.  While in Rome, McNamara was ordained for the diocese of Rochester on December 8, 1936.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">McNamara taught church history as a professor at St. Bernard's Seminary in Rochester, New York, from 1938 to 1981.  While joining a variety of academic (mostly historical) organizations, he was the founder and first president of Corning-Painted Post Historical Society (NY) from 1947 to 1948, the second vice president of American Catholic Historical Association (ACHA) from 1970 to 1971 as well as an advisory editor for Catholic Historical Review from 1948 to 1955.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Working as an archivist of the chancery archives of the diocese of Rochester, McNamara published The Diocese of Rochester, 1868-1968.  Besides American College in Rome, 1855-1955, his publications include Catholic Bicentennial Profiles, Catholic Sunday Preaching: The American Guidelines, 1791-1975, Century of Grace: The History of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Parish, Corning, 1848-1948, History of Sacred Heart Cathedral, and Rochester, New York, 1911-1961: A Historical Sketch. He was also an associate editor of Catholic Courier of Rochester.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">On November 6, 2005, his 95th birthday was celebrated by the parish members of Irondequoit's St. Thomas the Apostle where he had served as a priest-in-residence from 1981 to 2002.  On December 7, 2006, the 70th anniversary of his ordination was also celebrated.  The parish bulletin features the column entitled "Saints Alive" by McNamara which details a canonized person every week.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">As an historian as well as a graduate of the North American College, Reverend McNamara conducted major research in order to publish a book entitled American College in Rome, 1855-1955 (Rochester, NY: Christopher Press, 1956).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Robert Francis McNamara Papers consist primarily of research sources of the Pontifical North American College.  The North American College was originally founded in 1859 in Rome by Pius IX as a seminary exclusively for young American men pursuing priesthood.  The College currently has three divisions while adding the graduate house in 1933 and the Institute for Continuing Theological Education in 1970 to the seminary.   Today, the students attend from the United States, Canada and Australia.  The main campus is located on the Janiculum hill not distanced from St. Peter's Basilica while the graduate division is located on the Via dell'Umilta, close to Gregorian University and the Pontifical Biblical Institute.  The college was granted pontifical status by Leo XIII in 1884 and the ownership was granted as a tribute to the American hierarchy by Pius XII in 1948.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Sponsored by an American diocese and holding a college bachelor degree, the candidates for the Seminary Department have pursued the training to priesthood and most of them were eventually ordained.  Ordinations of those seminarians have been annual events of North American College.  From 1858 to 1933, those American seminarians attended the Urban College.  In 1933, it was switched to the Pontifical Gregorian University.  The seminarians of today may choose between Gregorian University and Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) for pursuing degrees while studying with people from all over the world.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The North American College was closed due to World War II, from 1940 to 1949.   After the war, the College was relocated from the original campus on Humility Street to Janiculum Hill where the College gained property in 1926.  The new building for the college was constructed from 1946 to 1953 under the rectorship of Martin J. O'Connor, and Pope Pius XII dedicated the completed new college on October 14, 1953. The College celebrated the centennial in 1959 and hosted Pope John XXIII for the event.</p>

          <h3>
            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">McNamara gathered this material mainly for the publication of The American College in Rome (Rochester, NY: Christopher Press, 1956) in which he described the history from the planning of the college in 1855 through 1955.  The collection covers the opening (1859), closing the college during World War II (1940-1949), the reopening (1949), the ceremony for the new campus (1953) and the centennial celebration (1959).  Since communications continued after the publication, the dates of the documents go through the 1960s, with some printed material going into the 1980s.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Robert McNamara Papers are divided into four Series:  Series 1, General and Personal Information; Series 2, Periodicals and Publications of North American College; Series 3, Photographs and Artifacts; and Series 4, Research Notecards.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 1 contains a variety of articles about the college and college events in publications as well as newspaper clippings.  However, the largest part of this series is correspondence and the memoirs, diaries, and letters by those who were students, rectors, and administrators of the college.  During the time of his rectorship of North American College (1946-1964), Martin J. O'Connor provided a wide range of information to McNamara.  Also, the letters written by the students of North American College, such as McNamara himself and Joseph P. Brennan to their parents through their school years in Rome, portray the lives of the American seminarians in Rome.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The former rectors of North American College include: Bernard Smith, O.S.B. (1859-1860); William G. McCloskey (1860-1868); Silas M. Chatard (1868-1878); Louis E. Hostlot (1868-1874); Augustin J. Schulte (1874-1875); Denis J. O'Connell (1875-1885); William H. O'Connell (1885-1901); Thomas F. Kennedy (1901-1917); Charles A. O'Hern (1917-1925); Eugene S. Burke (1925-1935); Ralph L. Hayes (1935-1944); J. Gerald Kealy (1944-1945); Martin J. O'Connor (1946-1964); Francis F. Reh (1964-1968); James A. Hickey (1969-1974)</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Among the important names are Archbishop Gaetano Bedini, Pope Pius IX's apostolic legate to the United States, who recommended that a formal nuncio be sent to the U.S. and that a North American College in Rome be established. Some others include early benefactors Angela Gormully and Nicholas Devereux.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Also, McNamara's efforts to create a list of all the graduates in a part of appendix of the publication can be seen in a variety of correspondence and was appreciated by many reviewers of the book.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 2 holds two major publications by North American College: Roman Echoes and Annual Report for Alumni.  This series also includes student directories from the 1960s and addresses from the 1953 North American College dedication ceremonies.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 3 contains the photographs and artifacts relating to North American College.  Photographs show various scenes of the College such as the buildings and quarters of the campus, student life, as well as some major events and incidents like the reopening of the College. This series also includes maps of Rome where the North American College was located.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 4 has notecards which McNamara created for his research. The content of the material dates from the 1850s until 1956, however, those dates do not refer to dates of creation.

				1933-1937 </font>
          </h3>
          <p>
This folder, and the next seven, are described by McNamara as follows:
"These are, for the most part, letters written from Europe by me, Rev. Robert F. McNamara during my residence in the North American College, Rome, 1933-1937.

They are addressed in major part to my mother, Mrs. Helen Divyer McNamara of 32 East 1st St. Corning, N.Y. ("Mom," "Nellie.").  Others are to my sister Madelene McNamara of the same address.  Some are to my brother, T.L. McNamara, M.D., likewise of Corning.  The letters are in chronological order.

The first batch of letters were given me by Msgr. J.F. Goggin of St. Bernard seminary from my personal file and relate to my application to enter the seminary.  The collegian signed "Burke," addressed to Madeline McNamara is for the then rector of the N.A.C., an earlier acquaintance of my sister's, confirming my acceptances at Rome.

There are also two letters from friends at Georgetown University when they learned and intended to study for the …..: Vincent J. McDonough, M. Perfect of Disceslin, and Roland Nelson Hoonan of Washington, of a class before me at G.U. where he later taught as professor of English and is now retired.

After the end of the collection, there are a few letters written Rome in 1950 while I was in Rome doing research on the N. American College.

Since all of these are interrelated and tell the story of one "bagarozzo" (as we Roman seminarians most to be called by anti-clericals in Rome).  I have include them all.  Rev. Robert F. McNamara/St. Bernard Seminary/Rochester NY 14612/January 8, 1981"
