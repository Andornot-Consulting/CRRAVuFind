            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Robert Theodore Meyer was born on August 6, 1911 to Louis and Clara Meyer in Cleveland, Ohio. As a child he attended local Catholic schools and graduated from St. Ignatius High School in 1929, with a focus in Classics. He then attended John Carroll University in Cleveland where he earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Classical Languages and Philosophy, in 1933 and 1934, respectively. Following his graduation, Meyer worked for the Baker Publishing Company while researching on a fellowship in Classics and German Philology at Western Reserve University. In 1937, he married Dorothy E. Deex in Berea, Ohio; they would have four children and remain married until Meyer's death.

After four years at Western Reserve, Meyer began his doctoral work at the University of Michigan in 1939, and in 1943 received his PhD  in Indo-European Linguistics. His dissertation was a study of the sources for the fourteenth century text "Sonyhurst Medulla." Due to his condition of high myopia, Meyer did not serve during World War II but worked for the engineering department of the King-Seeley Corporation from 1943 to 1946. During the early forties he also received several fellowships at the Linguistics Institute at the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina. After spending one year as an English Philology instructor at St. Louis University, he became an instructor of Comparative Philology at The Catholic University of America (CUA) in 1947.

During his career at CUA, Meyer held the Order of the Hibernians Chair in Celtic Studies from 1953-1976, taking over following the death of James A. Geary in 1953. Meyer was versed in Latin, Greek, Celtic, early Christian writings, German, and Icelandic. He also served as a fellow from 1947-1950 at John Hopkins University where he researched Romance Philology, Sanskrit, and Old Icelandic. He also taught English there from 1948-1949. He spent three summers at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in Celtic Philology, 1953-1955. This is where he published his most important work, "Merugud Uilix Meic Leirtis," in 1958.

Meyer also published works on the lives of St. Anthony, St. Athanasius, and St. John Chrysostom. He also lectured at Jesus College, Oxford, in Celtic Studies in 1961, 1965, 1968, 1970, and 1972, as well as a semester at Harvard University in 1970. Meyer was a member of many linguistic organizations including The Linguistic Society of America, The Medieval Academy of America, The Modern Language Association of America, and the American Philological Association. Also a devout Catholic, he was ordained a deacon for the Archdiocese of Washington in 1971, for Campus Ministry at Catholic University.

At the age of sixty-five, Meyer retired from Catholic University, and following his retirement he split his time between Washington and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. He continued to teach one course per semester at CUA and continued his research at CUA and abroad. Meyer died on October 3, 1987 in Swansea, Wales, after a bout of encephalitis. At the time of his death he had been touring Wales following a conference he attended. Meyer was considered one of the leading experts in Celtic Studies and Comparative Philology.
