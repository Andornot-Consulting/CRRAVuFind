          <p style="margin-left : 30pt">In 1942, Rev. Raymond McGowan met with Rev. Thomas Darby at an industrial conference in Brooklyn, New York.  Darby informed him that the children of labor leader John Mitchell had preserved his papers and were willing to donate them to the Catholic University of America.  McGowan referred him to Msgr. Francis J. Haas.  Haas, in consultation with the Procurator Rev. James Magner and the Librarian Francis Mullen, contacted two of the Mitchell children, Robert Mitchell and Mrs. Debaun Claydon, and arranged for these materials to be shipped to the library in December of 1943.  The Minutes of the Library and Museum Committee of 6 June 1947 state "that the university, in accepting the collection, made no financial provisions for cataloging it, in spite of the fact it had no archivist to do such work..." Over the years additional material was received from the Mitchell children as well as a significant donation of material that had been in the care of Mitchell's faithful secretary, Elizabeth Morris. The Mitchell Papers, sans most clippings and many photographs, was microfilmed in 1974 and a printed Guide was prepared by editor, John A Turcheneske, Jr.</p>

            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">John Mitchell was a legendary leader of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), serving as President from 1898 to 1908, and leading the fledgling union through one of labor history's most significant and successful strikes, the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902. A man of conservative dress and demeanor, he wrote two books, Organized Labor (1903) and The Wage Earner (1913), articulating his view that capital and labor could work together in 'class collaboration' if both were linked in prosperity. He was born 4 February 1870 in the coal mining village of Braidwood, Illinois. His parents, Robert Mitchell and Martha Halley, were poor immigrants from Ireland come to work in the Illinois coal fields. His mother died shortly after John's birth and his father died when the boy was only six years old. Reared by his father's third wife, a strict Presbyterian stepmother, he had little opportunity for education and assisted his stepmother in doing the neighborhood washing. Thus he learned early the lesson of self-dependence as impressed by poverty and bereavement. He left home at age 10 and began working as a farm laborer and, by age 12, as a trapper boy, opening and closing small doors that controlled ventilation in a coal mine. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Mitchell's career as a coal miner proceeded as he became a mule driver, a miner's helper, and finally a full blown coal miner. Though mostly working in Illinois, he also worked in both Colorado and New Mexico before returning to Illinois frustrated and broke. He had apparently decided the best way for coal miners to attain a better life was by organizing so he joined the Knights of Labor in 1885 at age 15. Five years later, in 1890, he was a founding member of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) union, an organization resulting from a meeting in Columbus, Ohio, of delegates of the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and of the National Progressive Union of Miners. Many British immigrants played an important role in the early days of the UMWA, with the Scottish born John Rae as the first President and the English born Robert Watchorn as the first Secretary. Later, the Scottish born William B. Wilson would work closely with Mitchell as Secretary-Treasurer, 1900-1908,  before going on to first a career in Congress and then as the first Secretary of Labor, 1913-1921, in the cabinet of Woodrow Wilson. Mitchell first served the UMWA as a legislative agent and was elected Secretary-Treasurer of District 12 (Illinois) in 1895. He became an international union organizer in 1897, working alongside the celebrated "Mother" Mary Harris Jones,  before being elected Vice President of the UMWA later that same year. Upon the resignation in September 1898 of President Michael Ratchford to become a member of the United States Industrial Commission, Mitchell became the acting UMWA President, winning election outright to the post in 1899.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In America, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century union activity was a risky business. Shortly before John Mitchell became President of the UMWA a coal strike in Lattimer, Pennsylvania, had tragic results when 19 miners were shot and killed. Learning from this example, many other miners silently endured horrible conditions, long hours, and little pay. Coal operators controlled the mines, the coal towns, and thus the coal miners. Miners were often paid with coupons that could only be redeemed at company stores with inflated prices. Miners were forced to buy and maintain their own tools and supplies such as dynamite for blasting and oil for their lamps. As UMWA president, Mitchell faced the challenge to incorporate, with the help of local leaders and clergy, new workers from various ethnic groups, with many language barriers as well as cultural biases to be overcome.  He respected the separate religious backgrounds and listened intently to their respective grievances. Miners found it easy to communicate with him, especially since he had worked in the mines himself, and they showed their affection for him by giving him the nickname of 'Johnnie da Mitch.' Many also respected him because his conservative dress and demeanor seemed to be priestly qualities. Mitchell also deserves much of the credit for swelling membership rolls. He would also have to provide key strike leadership.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In May 1902, a coal strike shut down the anthracite (harder and cleaner burning than bituminous) coal fields of eastern Pennsylvania as coal miners there, who worked twelve hour shifts, six days a week, for minimal pay, demanded a ten to twenty percent pay increase, an eight-hour work day, a fair system of weighing coal, and union recognition. John Mitchell presented the coal miners' grievances to the employers who rejected and refused to compromise. Tension rose as local police, hired detectives, and the Pennsylvania National Guard were mobilized. As the price of coal rose, schools in New York City were forced to close while angry citizens began chopping up telegraph poles for use as firewood. This induced U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to intervene, the first time an American president had done so, in a labor dispute as he believed the welfare of the American people must take precedence over both labor and capital. He invited both sides to Washington to meet in October 1902.  With both Mitchell and George Baer, leader of the employers in attendance, a compromise put forth by industrialist J.P. Morgan was accepted and the strike was over after 163 days. The agreement resulted in a ten percent pay increase, an eight hour work day for engineers and firemen, and a nine hour work day for other miners. The employers still refused to recognize the UMWA, but a committee was established to settle disputes that consisted of equal numbers of management and labor representatives. Mitchell's leadership of the strike won public acclaim for his moderate approach to industrial relations. He had also demonstrated that the southern and eastern European immigrants (the majority of anthracite miners) could be effectively organized into unions. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In the aftermath of his great success, however, Mitchell's growing conservatism, at least according to socialist critics like Thomas Lewis, began to estrange him from UMWA leaders and members, and, combined with declining health, eventually resulted in his resigning the Presidency in 1908 and being succeeded by Lewis. Mitchell then served as Chairman of the Trade Agreement Department of the National Civic Federation, an organization of employers and labor leaders dedicated to cooperative relations between businessmen and unions that he had helped found in 1900, though militants in the UMWA forced him to resign the position in 1911. He also continued to serve the UMWA as their representative at the conventions of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), an organization he also served as a Vice President from 1898 to 1914.  He was part of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, along with AFL President Samuel Gompers and AFL Secretary-Treasurer Frank Morrison, after all three were sentenced to prison by an appeals court for violating an injunction during a strike at the Buck Stove and Range Company in St. Louis. The Supreme Court overturned the contempt citation based upon the technicality that the appeals court was out of order in allowing the company to bring the complaint of contempt to them rather than in the district court itself.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In his last years, he was a member of the New York State Workman's Compensation Commission in 1914 and in 1915, when the Commission was merged with the New York Department of Labor Industrial Commission, he was appointed Chairman. He also served on the Federal Milk Commission, Federal Food Board for New York City, New York State Food Administration, and the New York State Council of Farms and Markets. Often in poor health, he died after an operation for gall stones, in New York City on 9 September, 1919, at the age of 49. He is buried in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the heart of the Anthracite region and site of his greatest triumph. There is also a statue of him there on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, with both the statue and courthouse as National Historic Landmarks. Mitchell had been very close to his secretary, Elizabeth Catherine Morris, who served him faithfully from his days as UMWA President until his death, and beyond, as she, along with his three children (he had married a miner's daughter named Catherine O'Rouke in 1892), did much to preserve his personal papers before they eventually ended up in the Catholic University Archives where they are currently housed.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Mitchell Papers contain correspondence, printed materials, and photographs, the majority of which is correspondence that includes carbon copies of Mitchell's replies to correspondents as well as drafts of articles, speeches, meeting minutes, financial reports, and convention resolutions. A significant portion of the papers were microfilmed in 1974 and organized into five series: Correspondence, 1885-1919; United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) Minutes, Proceedings, Constitutions, and Reports, 1891-1908; Miscellaneous Minutes, Proceedings, and Reports, 1914-1919; Printed Matter, 1888-1912; and Photographs, 1896-1924. Recent processing efforts have resulted in revised dates, listed below, for most of these series. Also, the remaining part of the collection not microfilmed has since been largely organized into a sixth series titled Miscellaneous and Unprocessed, 1884-1924, and undated. The microfilm edition of the Mitchell papers is available in many libraries and the Guide to the Microfilm Edition (1974), edited by John A. Turcheneske, and is especially valuable in its content listing of the microfilm reels. Staff at the American Catholic History Research Center and University Archives of The Catholic University of America (CUA) prepared a corresponding box list, with both listings incorporated below. This finding aid is presented not as a finished product but as an effort to make the collection more accessible even though a complete folder listing is not yet available.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 1, Correspondence, 1885-1931, and undated, is by far the largest and most significant series and reflect his actions as President of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) from 1898 to 1908, Chairman of the Trade Agreement Department of the National Civic Federation from 1908 to 1911, Vice President of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) from 1898 to 1914, member of the New York Food, Industrial, and Workman's Compensation commissions from 1914 to 1919, and several other positions. The UMWA correspondence is probably the most important, including the struggle for standardized wages, an eight hour work day, safe working conditions, and recognition as the sole bargaining agent for coal miners. In sorting through this it was found that there is actually material dated as late as 1931, and not 1919, as listed in the 1974 Microfilm Guide. Correspondence is arranged chronologically by year, month, and day.  That dated only by month and year is located at the end of the month, and that dated only by year is located at the end of the year.  All undated correspondence is located at the end of dated correspondence.  Significant correspondents include Frank Farrington, William Green, John P. White, John H. Walker, Frank Morrison, Samuel Gompers, W.P. Fairley, and 'Mother' Mary Harris Jones.  There is both a box listing and a corresponding microfilm reel listing where relevant as well as an index of correspondents with over 30,000 entries available in-house that can be searched upon requests being made to the Archives staff at archives@mail.lib.cua.edu.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 2, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) Minutes, Proceedings, Constitutions, and Reports, 1891-1919, contains material focused on but not limited to the years John Mitchell was affiliated with the UMWA in a leadership capacity, 1898-1908. Material dated 1891-1908, with some exceptions, were microfilmed, while those dated 1909-1919 were not. However, the latter had been marked to be microfilmed and so were included in this current arrangement of the papers.  Overall, the materials include typescript minutes of the National Executive Board meetings and a report of a special convention regarding the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902 as well as printed national and district convention proceedings and union constitutions and by-laws. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 3, Miscellaneous Minutes, Proceedings, and Reports, 1902-1919, constitutes an often incomplete hodgepodge of minutes and reports from several organizations other than the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) that Mitchell served. Foremost among these are the American Federation of Labor (AFL) with typescript minutes of the AFL Executive Council, 1902-1913; typescript reports of the AFL President, 1907-1910; and typescript minutes of the Secretary, 1902-1913. There are also typescript minutes of the New York State Food Commission, 1917-1919; the New York States Industrial Commission, 1914-1919; and the New York State Workman's Compensation Commission, 1914-1919.
Series 4, Printed Matter, 1876-1918, consists of miscellaneous pamphlets and newspaper clippings regarding labor related issues. The first part consists of 45 numbered pamphlets, 1888-1912, that were microfilmed. They are arranged alphabetically by author and/or title with bibliographic entries provided in the reel listing in the Microfilm Guide. Subjects include the eight hour work day, miners' working conditions, and the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902. In addition, there are several additional printed items, 1876-1918 and undated, apparently reviewed to be considered but not ultimately selected for microfilming, that are included in this arrangement. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 5, Photographs, 1896-1924, includes many portraits of important people, such as Clarence Darrow and Theodore Roosevelt, as well as significant events, like the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902 and the First World War.  There are also photographs illustrating mining techniques of the time and featuring the Beech Flats Coal Company and the Kehota Mining Company. The first part consist of 83 numbered photos that were microfilmed and an additional 150 images that were not selected, including several only recently discovered and pulled from Series 6. All 231 images are included as part of an on-line digital collection of John Mitchell's photos created by the Digital Collections Production Center (DCPC) of the Washington Research Libraries Consortium (WRLC) in 2008-2009 at http://www.aladin.wrlc.org/gsdl/collect/mitchell/mitchell.shtml.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 6, Miscellaneous and Unprocessed, 1884-1924, and undated, is a miscellany of material received decades ago from John Mitchell's children and his secretary, Elizabeth Morris. It has not been organized and was not included in the 1970s microfilming project. The majority of this series consists of miscellaneous newspaper clippings, much of it brittle and difficult to use, that appears to have been gathered by a clipping service, with a large portion of it focused on the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902.  There is also a significant amount of printed matter that is an assortment of pamphlets and booklets in relatively good condition, and which might eventually be pulled and added to an historical pamphlet collection somewhere. This series also includes some stray typescript minutes and reports from the UMWA, AFL, and several other organizations.  Finally, there is a small but significant section of personal papers, largely family photographs, belonging to Mitchell's faithful secretary, Elizabeth Morris. </p>

          <p>The photographs, 1896-1924, entail many portraits of important people, such as Clarence Darrow and Theodore Roosevelt, as well as significant events like the 1902 Anthracite Coal Strike. There are 231 numbered photos, with all of these digitized and made available as part of the John Mitchell Digital Collection at http://www.aladin.wrlc.org/gsdl/collect/mitchell/mitchell.shtml sponsored by the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC). In addition, the first 83 numbered photographs were microfilmed in 1974 along with many of the documents.</p>
