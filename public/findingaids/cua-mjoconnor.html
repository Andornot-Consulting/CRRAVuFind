            <b>Acquisition Information</b>
          </h4>
          <p style="margin-left : 30pt">The acquisition of the O'Connor Collection began in 1971 with the transfer, from Marywood College in Scranton, Pennsylvania, of four large wooden crates and eight cardboard cartons containing document files, photograph albums, miscellaneous materials, and scrapbooks. A label from this shipment (in Accession file number two) indicates that a letter of instruction for the disposition of the collection remains on file with the President of Marywood.</p>
          <p style="margin-left : 30pt">Over the next ten years, from April 1971 to July 1980, Archbishop O'Connor sent his papers and memorabilia to the archivists and librarians of The Catholic University of America in 197 airmail and parcel post packages, and one rather large parcel sent in 1973.</p>
          <p style="margin-left : 30pt">Finally, in 2008, the CUA Archives received a small collection of photographs, correspondence, and Archbishop O'Connor's passport, which had been in the personal files of Monsignor John P. Gallagher (1924-2007) of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who had been Archbishop O'Connor's designated biographer. Upon Monsignor Gallagher's death, Gallagher's sister, Margaret Miller, contributed the remaining O'Connor materials to the collection at CUA.</p>

            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Martin John O'Connor was born in Scranton, PA on May 18, 1900 to Martin John (senior) and Belinda (Caffrey) O'Connor. He was the long-time Rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome (1946-1963), and the founding President of the Papal Commission for Social Communication (1948-1971). He also served as titular Archbishop of Laodicia (1948-1970) and papal nuncio to Malta (1965-1969).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">O'Connor completed a Ph.D. in Theology at the Pontifical North American College in Rome in 1924, and a Ph.D. in Canon Law at the Faculty of the Lateran in 1929.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">O'Connor was ordained in Rome in 1924, and then returned to Pennsylvania where he served as assistant pastor of St. Peter's Cathedral in Scranton from 1925 to 1927. He was assistant editor of the Catholic Light, the Scranton Diocesan newspaper, from 1929 to 1932. From 1925 to 1935 he was secretary to the Bishop, and then became Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton from 1943 to 1946. He also served as the Pastor of St. Mary Parish in Wilkes-Barre from 1943 to 1946. In 1946, Bishop O'Connor was called back to Rome to take over as Rector of the Pontifical North American College, which had been vacant during the years of World War II.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">On assuming the Rectorship in 1946, O'Connor began the rehabilitation of its buildings at Castel Gandolfo and the Via dell'Umilitá, which had fallen into disuse and been taken over by war refugees and students from other Vatican programs. In 1948, with this reconstruction two years short of completion, O'Connor broke ground for a new college campus on the Janiculum Hill, for which he had, by 1953, raised $4.5 million from the dioceses of America and Canada. The campus was officially dedicated by Pius XII in October 1953. By the time of his retirement from the school in 1963, O'Connor had built it from its initial postwar student body of 40, to 280 students, representing some 110 dioceses in North America.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">During these years in Rome, Bishop O'Connor accepted a charge from Pius XII (beginning in 1948), to organize a Commission for religious and didactic films. This Commission grew over the next twenty years to include all broadcast and commercial media, becoming the Pontifical Commission for Social Communications. In the early 1960s, this Commission was tasked with principal responsibility for Vatican press relations and public communication during the Second Vatican Council.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Archbishop O'Connor was awarded one of Italy's highest decorations when he was named Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1957, and in September 1959 was named titular Archbishop of Laodicia in Syria by John XXIII. Archbishop O'Connor served as a member of the General Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council, and served during the Council as a member of the Commission for the Lay Apostolate. In 1966, he was appointed Vice President of the post-conciliar version of that Commission. Pope Paul VI named Archbishop O'Connor the Vatican's first apostolic nuncio to Malta in 1965; he served in this position until his retirement in 1971. In 1968, he was named a consultor to the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. After his retirement, O'Connor returned to the United States in 1979. He died in Wilkes-Barre, PA on December 1, 1986.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This collection comprises the personal papers, records, photographs, correspondence, awards, mementos, and memorabilia accumulated by Archbishop Martin John O'Connor during a career that began with his ordination in 1924 and lasted through his retirement in 1971 at age seventy. The collection begins with 54 boxes of files organized into 5 series; Box 6 contains restricted personnel records. Further to the manuscripts are an additional 25 photographic albums of mounted and captioned photographs that begin with O'Connor's years in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then continue with the eventful history of the Pontifical North American College in Rome during the years of Archbishop O'Connor's Rectorship, between 1946 and 1963.  These may be found in Series 6. A 2013 reprocessing served to unite the entire body of the collection, which had once been partitioned due to lengthy restrictions on access, after some 40 years. This now re-establishes context to the some 3400 professional photos in the collection that have long been available though rarely seen.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 1 is the correspondence and diaries of Archbishop O'Connor begin during his studies in Rome and his early career in Scranton, including newspaper articles written by O'Connor during his years as the assistant editor of the Diocesan newspaper, and transcripts of his Catholic Hour radio addresses during 1941. Located in Series 1, the Scranton files also contain O'Connor's episcopal and lay correspondence as Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton. There is also administrative correspondence relating to his various board memberships during the 1940's.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 2 contains files from the late 1940's through the early 1960s. It compiles his records as Rector of the North American Pontifical College as well as those pertaining to the American episcopal board which oversaw the re-opening of the college after WWII. Here one will find extensive correspondence on U.S.-Vatican relations in the years leading up to the Second Vatican Council. Among the subseries are two boxes (20 and 33) of correspondence reflecting O'Connor's capacity as a key liaison to the papacy.  Box 20 is notable for his over 20 year tenure as President of the multi-faceted Pontifical Committee for Social Communications - a somewhat discreet position of considerable influence upon global Catholicism.  It also contains a partial itinerary of Bishop O'Connor's fundraising travels in America and Canada.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 3 chronicles  O'Connor's activities after resigning from the North American College in 1964 at height of his influence in the Vatican.  Somewhat more popularly known as a chief public relations official for the Second Vatican Council, O'Connor was then permitted to focus extensively on Pontifical Communications Media  in tandem with his subsequent appointment as apostolic nuncio to Malta. The collection however, contains little material on Vatican II despite the some 43 press conferences O'Connor allegedly oversaw. There is also minimal specific correspondence on Malta despite his almost 4 years as a nuncio. Prolific in retirement, there are several boxes of papers from 1971 through his death in 1986. A number of these are unprocessed.  Included are O'Connor's materials donated by biographer (who never finished his work) Monsignor John P. Gallagher, a CUA graduate and fellow Scranton priest.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 4  consists of the personal appointment books of Archbishop O'Connor, housed in a single box. Series 5 contains miscellany from Archbishop O'Connor's life and career, including oversized photos, scrapbooks, official documentation, and various honors and gifts. Included in series five is the honorary degrees and various medal he received over the course of his lifetime. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 6 consists of 25 photographic albums compiled and labeled under the guidance of Dr. Frank J. Witty and Mr. Lloyd F. Wagner. With photographs stretching from 1919-1971, it covers most of the professional life of Archbishop O'Connor. The bulk of the collection focuses on his work with the North American College in the postwar years, as well as his presidency of the Pontifical Media Communications Commission and as Nuncio to Malta. The photographs highlight not only the extraordinary events of the Archbishop's time in Rome - visits with Popes and Presidents, the opening of Vatican II, and canonization ceremonies - but also captures the daily life of the North American College, its students, and its Rector. Series 7 wraps up the collection with three scrapbooks from Archbishop O'Connor's active life, including one dedicated to the official proclamations associated with his many honors and ecclesiastical titles.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Monsignor Gallagher contributed to the initial processing of the Archbishop Martin J. O'Connor Papers and his imprimatur not only provides significant access points to its contents, but presents a portrait of O'Connor's seemingly inexhaustible capacity to represent American interests in Rome at a critical time in the Cold War. In total, the Archbishop Martin J. O'Connor Papers chronicle the extensive rehabilitation, reconstruction, and expansion of the College during the postwar years and continued with the establishment of the College as an American door to the Vatican during the 1950s' - years of increased American presence in Europe. The College and its Rector welcomed many significant visitors including: Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Nixon; a second visit by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy; Papal Ambassadors Clare Boothe Luce and John McCone; numerous visits by American Cardinals; and Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, and Paul VI. Extensive photographic records of two papal funerals and the ceremonies surrounding the second Vatican Council are also featured in the collection. Those interested specifically in the pre-war and post-war history of North American College are also recommended to the Rev. Robert F. McNamara Papers which contain an abundance of related reports not found in the O'Connor collection.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>Series 2 chronicles Bishop O'Connor's life-changing assignment to re-open the Pontifical North American College in Rome post-World War II. Accordingly, many communications are in Italian or Latin. In this Series, he is alternately known as the college Rector and later as Archbishop O'Connor. Throughout his tenure as Rector, O'Connor also sat on the Pontifical Committee for Social Communications (through its many iterations) and would become the committee's president at the behest of the pontiff. These dual roles frequently overlapped in practice and the following Subseries make distinctions where possible. Please see the scope and content note for additional detail.</p>

          <p>Subseries 2.2 This single box sub-series highlights the hugely influential PCCM. Established in 1948, the Commission represented a papal initiative to incorporate expanding mass media technology into a supra-pastoral configuration with global reach. The 38 folders document all manner of public relations with the burgeoning media industry. From its inception until 1971 (when O'Connor retired)the Commission underwent several name changes to include newer technologies. Please note there are few specific resources relating to Vatican II despite O'Connor's significant contribution as a laisson to the press corps.</p>

          <p>Series 3 consists of 14 boxes documenting Archbishop O'Connor's papers in the post Vatican II era. These are chronologically arranged and a number of them are unprocessed. The Second Vatican Council coincided with O'Connor's retirement as Rector of the North American College in late 1964 to become the Apostolic Nuncio to Malta for 4 years.  The results of this transition permitted him to remain in Rome and to renew his capacity as the President of the Pontifical Council for Communications Media where he would remain until 1971. The correspondence from the 1970's and 1980's mostly chronicle the final stages of his episcopal career in Rome and eventual return to the U.S. One will also find extensive documentation of the 1971 Synod of Bishops(Rome) as well as the 50th Anniversary of his consecration (1974).</p>
