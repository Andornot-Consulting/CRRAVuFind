            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Cardinal and diplomat Aloisius Muench was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 18, 1889 to German immigrant parents, Joseph and Theresa (Kraus) Muench. He received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from the St. Francis de Sales Seminary, June 8, 1913, and was ordained a priest. In 1919, Muench obtained a Masters degree from the University of Wisconsin, followed by his doctoral degree three years later in 1921, from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Muench continued his post-graduate studies at Oxford, Louvain, and the Sorbonne until he returned to his alma mater in 1923, and became a professor of dogmatic theology, social science, homiletics, and catechetics. St. Francis de Sales appointed him Dean of the Department of Theology and he served as Rector of the Seminary from 1929 to 1935.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">He was named a Monsignor in 1934, elevated as Third Bishop of Fargo, North Dakota, in 1935, and appointed President of the National Catholic Rural Life Conference in 1939. During this time, Muench organized the Catholic Church Expansion Fund to aid and develop poorer parishes, began a Priest's Mutual Aid Fund, and regularly published a diocesan newspaper. Additionally, throughout his twenty-four years as Bishop of Fargo, North Dakota, Muench wrote an annual Lenten pastoral letter. The most famous of these letters, One World in Charity (1946), was a plea for the just treatment of our former enemies and it condemned the Morgenthau plan of restricting Germany to a rural economy. A translation of this letter was widely disseminated in Germany. Other Muench publications, such as the Annual Reports to the American Bishops and the weekly column, The Bishop Writes, portray the specific problems and conditions facing the German Catholic Church and detail Muench's work in Germany. Each of Muench's publications dealt in some way with the organization of charity, drawing from his training and daily practice.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">German capitulation in 1945 created a country divided into four occupation zones with no central government. To help with the situation, Pope Pius XII established the Vatican Mission to organize and coordinate the religious work of the various national groups of Catholic Displaced Persons (DPs) as well as fill in the gaps in relief activities not covered by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Archbishop Carlo Chiarlo served from the fall of 1945 to January of 1946 as the first Apostolic Visitator to Germany; Father Ivo Zeiger, S.J. headed the Mission until the summer of 1946, when the Pope deferred to the wishes of the American Occupation forces by naming an American, Bishop Muench, to head the Mission. As Visitator, Bishop Muench supervised and coordinated internal religious affairs in Germany, and advised and assisted the Catholic Bishops. He also maintained relations with the Holy See in all matters having a bearing on the interests of the Catholic Church in Germany with tasks were similar to those of the Apostolic Delegate in Washington. To facilitate his work, General Clay gave Bishop Muench on August 16, 1946, the privilege of uncensored communication and the use of a diplomatic pouch and cable code messages.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Also in 1946, the U.S. Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, named Bishop Muench as liaison consultant for religious affairs to the military governor of Germany. In this capacity he was advisor to General Lucius Clay and his successors on matters involving the German Catholic Church and the American Army of Occupation. At the request of Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York, and Military Ordinary for all the American Catholic chaplains in the Armed Forces, Bishop Muench was named Military Vicar Delegate for Catholic chaplains in Germany and Austria. After 1951, Muench assumed the titles of Regent of the Papal Nunciature in Germany, Archbishop, and Papal Nuncio to Germany, with dual diplomatic and ecclesiastical responsibilities. Muench became a Cardinal in 1959, resigned as bishop of Fargo, and was assigned to Rome. Additionally, he was given membership in the Sacred Congregations of Religious, Rites, and Extraordinary Affairs that same year. Cardinal Aloisius Muench died on February 15, 1962 in Rome, and was interred in St. Mary's Cemetery, Fargo. </p>

The papers thoroughly document virtually all aspects of the Cardinal's unusual career as the first American in the Vatican diplomatic service though they do not contain any of his official papers as Apostolic Visitator or Papal Nuncio to Germany. In the words of Dr. Frederic Spotts "... until one or another of the major German dioceses open their archives these papers will comprise .... the single best collection on the Catholic side on ecclesiastical-political affairs available to scholars."</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 1 consists of Cardinal Muench's personal diaries and notebooks, 1906-1961.  Cardinal Muench made sporadic efforts to keep a diary, however, his notes are most extensive for the years he spent abroad, i.e. 1919-22, and 1946-61. They record all his conversations with Adenauer and Pius XII, as well as other leading dignitaries. This series contains much fascinating detail and is arranged chronologically when possible.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Series 2, the General Correspondence Series, 1946-1962,  includes records of transactions (private or, occasionally, official) with the U.S. hierarchy and clergy, and with German and American laity; correspondence relating to the U.S. Catholic relief project in Germany, and to advisory and honorary positions held in diplomatic circles and in Catholic lay and social action organizations. Contacts maintained with officials and officers of the Catholic Central Union (Verein) of America, with the National Catholic Rural Life Conference, and with Bishop William T. Mulloy, indicate a lasting interest in social action, and in aspects of rural and agricultural life. Important documents include copies of an interview with President Harry S. Truman (10/3), a Muench letter to Truman concerning allegations of Spanish religious prejudice (10/3), Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's letter of apology, in his own hand, to Muench (10/3), discussions with Bishop Vincent J. Ryan of Bismarck, N.D., pertaining to teaching sisters in North Dakota public schools, and the sisters' school garb controversy. Arrangement is hierarchical by position or office held; thereunder, chronological or alphabetical by surname or initial letter.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 3, 1946-1961, includes much of his personal correspondence condolences after his death as collected by diocesan personnel in addition to cards, telegrams, and newspaper clippings; arrangement booklets and invitation lists; personal financial statements, and an investments' portfolio. Though greetings, invitations, and congratulations abound, prominence has been given to two important events in Muench's life: his elevation to the Cardinalate and his silver jubilee as a bishop. Composed principally of letters received and copies of letters sent, significant additions of handwritten letters sent were acquired by the Diocese of Fargo from his sister, Teresa E. Muench; typed letters sent were obtained from Charles E. Muench. Some family correspondence (Muench letters sent) date from 1912, 1919-22, (10), and 1935. Following the Cardinal's death in 1962, diocesan personnel and Sister Ilga, O.S.B., from his staff at the Nunciature in Germany, added correspondence, documents, certificates, policies, inventory lists, and invoices pertaining to his last illness, funeral, personal effects, and burial. Entries are easily ascertained by date of entry. Important and noteworthy events include a report on a trip to the eastern zone of Germany, and remarks on Vatican-West German relations (42/29-37). Records pertaining to family history, formative education received, biographical data, and family correspondence are given precedence. Thereafter, for many succeeding group and subject designations, entries are organized alphabetically. When further indicated, chronological or alphabetical arrangement at elementary levels has been provided.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Although Series 4, the Diocese of Fargo Correspondence and Records Series, 1934-1962,  consists principally of copies of the Cardinals' letters sent and reports and letters received, the correspondences of Auxiliary Bishop Leo F. Dworschak and others with third parties has been intermingled and purposely inter filed with those of Muench. Interpolations like these have been so designated and left standing; no attempt to gather them for separate arrangement was considered appropriate. Under entries for "Chancery", "Leo F. Dworschak", "Priests", "Sisters", "Statistics", and "Financial Records", important diocesan matters are discussed. These include: spiritual and financial administration of the diocese, allocation of resources, parish and school planning, pastoral counseling and formation, liturgical and canonical (synodal) revisions, building programs, jurisdictional problems, local and personal news; also charitable works of priests, sisters, and laity, regarding Muench's German mission. Statistical, financial, and investment entries complete this series. Organized hierarchically, group associations precede named individuals and individual correspondents are alphabetized by name. Afterwards, for entries on a lower level, the plan is strictly chronological.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 5, records forming the Vatican Mission Correspondence, 1945-1959,  pertains to the effects on Vatican representation and German sovereignty of the policies adopted by allied governments of occupation; specifically, to temporarily unresolved jurisdictional problems encountered by Muench as head of the Third Vatican Mission, the absence of diplomatic accreditation, inadequate location of Nunciature, together with factors affecting appointments as Visitator, Regent, and Nuncio. Also included are: observations on the German Church, the purpose in reestablishing the Mission, correspondence with household and diplomatic staffs, and with officials of the Secretariat of State, primarily of a personal nature; and mostly consisting of letters of greeting, acknowledgment, and appreciation. Entries arranged chronologically correspond to the Cardinal's successive appointments; coordinate topical headings and entries for individual correspondents are listed alphabetically.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Covering the activities of the Nuncio as administrator of the post-war relief effort established by Pius XII, Series 6,the Papal Relief Commission Series, 1946-1959,  consists primarily of correspondence, documents, reports, charts, summaries, and statistical compilations best characterized by attitudes of assessment, petition, and acknowledgment. Much pertains to the organization, administration, and execution of relief policies by individuals and groups from the United States and Germany. Especially noteworthy in respect of American Catholic relief were Muench's contacts with the Administrative Board of the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC), now the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB),  its committees, bureaus, and councils, and with German and other Caritas federations, clergy, religious, land laity. Such private efforts were largely sustained by the generosity of American Catholics who made possible immediate and long-term assistance to German citizens, and to displaced and refugee populations from Soviet occupied regions of Germany and Central and Eastern Europe. Information contained in "Financial Records" consists of receipts, cash books, ledgers, and other raw data on the Vatican Mission Group personally compiled by the Cardinal. A section titled "Papal Relief" contains accounts of Vatican interest in, and aid extended to, multi-national, priests, religious, and laymen, through its bureaus, commissions and committees. Major headings and subordinate entries are organized alphabetically.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 7, the Liaison Consultant Series, 1946-1959,  contains correspondence, affidavits, reports, legal briefs, petitions, regulations, transcripts, travel orders, and more papers relating to Muench's interests and activities as advisor to the U.S. Military Governor on religious affairs, and falling within the jurisdictions of the Religious, Civil Affairs, and Legal branches of the U.S. Military Government, Germany. Included are personal and official contacts with U.S. High Commissioners, Military Governors, Land Commissioners, and their subordinates. Such correspondence is characterized by emphasis placed on aspects of Muench's personal involvement in German religious, civil, and political matters; on displaced, refugee, and expellee populations; on allied implementation of denazification programs; on war crimes, war criminals, and prisoners of war. Important, though inexhaustive, treatment is accorded to matters discussed under "Commissioners and Military Governors", "Denazification", "German POW's", and "War Crimes". Unless indicated, entries for "Liaison Consultant" are alphabetical by subject; and chronological or alphabetical by file unit depending on attributes and utility.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Series 8, the Military Vicar Delegate Series, 1946-1956,  are arranged alphabetically by subject and chronologically by file unit. Included are attendance reports, reports of marriage, baptisms, and other documents related to priestly ordination, faculties, and dispensations exchanged with the Vicar General, etc following his appointment by the NCWC.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Constituting the Cardinal's personal files and pertaining to his internal and spiritual mission before the German Church, Series 9, the German Catholic Church Series also includes many informative parts describing Muench's external and civil mission. The latter is characterized here by discussion of selected social, political, and economic situations affecting the normal and extraordinary administration of the Church. Such activities are manifested, particularly, in Muench's interaction with the German episcopate, officials of the U.S. Military Government, and with German officials, over educational reform. Issues raised by the implementation of oppressive policies in East Germany, affecting its Catholic population, are also considered. Other, subject, categories fall topically into categories relating to his interest in the conditions and laws regulating marriage and the family, religious national congresses, conferences, unions, housing and settlement, youth leagues, the press, and other societies and groups. Under major headings, the entries are listed alphabetically by subject and site; and chronologically by file unit.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Muench's Miscellaneous Series, Series 10, undated, is arranged by topic. It contains photographs, newspapers and magazine clippings, correspondence, and pamphlets pertaining to the Cardinal's visit to Malta as Legate, in connection with its celebration of the 1900th anniversary of St. Paul's shipwreck there. Additionally, there are materials from Muench's "Wooden Church Crusade".</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Divided into two parts, Series 11, the Literary Series, is largely Muench's own unpublished writings under the headings: "Addresses;" "Sermons;" "Pastoral Letters;" "The Archbishop Writes;" and "The Church in Germany" (Annual Report to the American Bishops). The second part, or "Printed Matter", contains Muench's and others' published books, pamphlets, and articles. Of particular interest are box 44 with its contents of Catholic Congresses in Germany, and box 52/7-8 War Criminal Prison Data -- short biographies of Germans accused of being Nazi criminals and processed in the American Occupied Zone of Germany. The literary file is arranged alphabetically within the two sub-series: (1) "Addresses, Essays, and Sermons," and (2) "Printed Matter;" and chronologically within the sub-groups.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 12, the Clippings Series is extensive and details the tracing of Muench's almost daily activities in Germany through the NCWC News Service, the German Catholic newspaper clipping service, Katholische Nachrichten Agentur (KNA), and some other clippings. The sub-series "Topical Clippings" consists of various subjects of interest to Cardinal Muench. The clipping file is arranged chronologically within alphabetically sub-groups.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 13, the Biography series has the source material and manuscript of Father Colman J. Barry's biography of Muench: American Nuncio: Cardinal Aloisius Muench (1969). Father Barry, generously added to the Muench collection the twenty-six taped interviews he made with the Cardinal's former associates and contemporaries. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 14, the last part of the papers which comprise the Prints and Photographs Series, are arranged chronologically and range from personal portrait photographs to travel photos from Muench's trips to Paris. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Prior to the completion of reprocessing in 2006, the collection used a different numbering system.  That has been retained with the new folder listing.  The old numbering system uses the box number followed by a slash and then the folder number, such as 53/4 for box 53, folder 4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1991, a manuscript processor at CUA noted approximately thirty individual documents and six folders missing from the collection. Although the documents may have been misfiled, the common location of where they dissapeared from suggests they were removed intentionally. This finding aid notes where those documents were previously located in the container list with the word "missing."</p>

          <p>Consists principally of copies of the Cardinals' letters sent and reports and letters received. The correspondences of Auxiliary Bishop Leo F. Dworschak and others with third parties has been intermingled and purposely interfiled with those of Muench. Interpolations like these have been so designated and left standing; no attempt to gather them for separate arrangement was considered appropriate. Organized hierarchically, group associations precede named individuals. Individual correspondents are alphabetized by name. Afterwards, for entries on a lower level, the plan is strictly chronological.</p>

          <p>The source material for American Nuncio: Aloisius Cardinal Muench (1969) by the Reverend Coleman J. Barry, O.S.B. has remained as the author arranged it for the biography. Therefore, Series N consists of a mere listing of folder captions. Furthermore, the series is not included in the "Selective Index," as the book has an excellent index.</p>
