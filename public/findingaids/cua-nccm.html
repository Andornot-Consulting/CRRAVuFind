              <td>The NCCM was established in 1920 as part of the Lay Organizations Department of the National Catholic Welfare Council (NCWC). Its various functions included the federation of Catholic men's groups, to be a central clearinghouse for information on lay activities, to promote lay cooperation, to help existing Catholic lay organizations on the local level, to contribute to national and international movements with moral questions, and to inculcate appreciation of Catholic principles in society. It operated through a committee system on national, diocesan, and parish levels and published a monthly news organ and other publications as well. It operated a film distribution office and a New York radio and television office, from which it produced The Catholic Hour, 1930-1968. It was briefly merged with NCCW to form the National Council of Catholic Laity, before going defunct in 1975. Records include constitutions, bylaws, and incorporation; minutes of the Board of Directors; reports and convention proceedings; general correspondence including national organizations and diocesan; Catholic Hour radio and television scripts, transcripts, audio tapes, photographs, and phonographs; and miscellaneous publications.

          <h3>
            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The roots of the Roman Catholic laity in the United States of America, a group referred to as 'The Faithful' in the seminal book by James O'Toole, date back to European colonization beginning in the fifteenth century with Spanish missions, extends through English colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on the eastern seaboard, and continues with the thriving immigrant church of the American republic.  In the decades before the American Civil War, and continuing thereafter, there were increased numbers of Catholic immigrants, mostly Irish and German. As they assimilated and became more established, they became eager to emulate the types of charity work being done by their Protestant counterparts. This included such activities as temperance, poor relief, and resettlement by the founding of organizations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians in New York City in 1836 and affiliating with such existing groups as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in 1845.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Catholics also wanted to show that while much Protestant charity, in their view, came from upper class largesse, Catholics efforts were the result of working class sacrifices inspired by faith in time tested papal encyclicals and other old world values. They did, however, want to be accepted by American society and demonstrate that Catholics were not foreign and intemperate paupers. They took part in the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, with a Columbian Exposition designed to demonstrate the Catholic place in American history. These lay Catholics efforts also took place at a time when internal conflicts arose among ethnic groups like the Irish and the Germans while new waves of immigrants, primarily Italian and Polish, from southern and Eastern Europe respectively fomented renewed anti-Catholic sentiments among non-Catholic Americans. There was also the Vatican suspicion about American ideas in the Church that resulted in the 1899 condemnation of 'Americanism.' It is not surprising then that the Vatican had special concerns about the U.S. and formally considered it a mission country until 1908.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">As the twentieth century dawned there were increasing efforts at national Catholic unity and a greater role for the laity. This is evidenced by the organization of the American Federation of Catholic Societies in 1901, the Daughters of Isabella (later the Catholic Daughters of America) in 1903, the Catholic Education Association (later the National Catholic Education Association) in 1904, and the National Conference of Catholic Charities (later Catholic Charities USA) in 1910. This trend continued after the outbreak of the First World War, with Catholic leaders, hoping to demonstrate Catholic loyalty, created the National Catholic War Council (NCWC) in 1917, an emergency organization based in Washington, D.C., representing Catholic interests by addressing the needs of soldiers at home and overseas, promoting the Americanization of recent immigrants, and developing a Program for the Social Reconstruction of American society. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">After the end of hostilities, the War Council was succeeded by the National Catholic Welfare Council (known since 2001 as the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops), which was composed of the American Catholic hierarchy and its standing secretariat. Thereafter, the NCWC blossomed into the single most important national organization in the American Catholic Church through the middle years of the twentieth century. It became the principal Catholic lobbyist with the federal government against federal aid to education bills for fear such laws would impose government controls on private schools; though later it would fight for parochial school funding. The NCWC issued national guidelines and provided training and national coordination for hosts of local Catholic societies. This was especially true for the Lay Organizations Department that oversaw the activities of the fledgling National Council of Catholic Men (NCCM) and the National Council of Catholic Women (NCCW). It served as a channel for the interchange of information and service between the bishops and the laity in promoting Catholic principles and ideals in education, social, and civic life. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The NCCM was organized on September 29, 1920 in Washington, D.C. with a structure that included parish councils that were in turn part of district and then diocesan councils. Initial activities included study clubs, support of scouting, and outreach to minorities and immigrants. There were also efforts to influence legislation, motion pictures, and the press against perceived anti-Catholic prejudice. Membership included subscriptions to the 'NCWC Bulletin' and NCCM's 'Information Bulletin' (and later additional publications such as 'Alert' and 'Catholic Men'). By 1924, there were 1,025 affiliates in 87 dioceses. In 1926, there was a strong emphasis on the religious turmoil in Mexico, with efforts to lobby interested parties and care for refugees. By 1928, promotional work focused on supporting Catholic radio stations nationally and opposing birth control legislation. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The tenth anniversary of NCCM's founding in 1930 was a watershed year. There were 1,464 affiliated lay societies, including eight national such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), the Catholic Central Verein, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. Six permanent NCCM committees were established:  Catholic Education, Crime and Disregard of Law, Practical Apologetics, Industrial Problems, Catholic Press, and Organization and Development.  The National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) offered free use to sponsor a Catholic radio hour, which was approved by the bishops. 'The Catholic Hour' was inaugurated on March 2, 1930 by NBC and was broadcast every Sunday from 6 pm to 7 p.m. initially on 24 stations but reaching 47 stations in 28 states by end of the year. Notable early speakers included John J. Burke, Fulton J. Sheen, and George Johnson and some 100,000 print copies of Catholic Hour addresses, including nearly 20,000 of Sheen's 'Divine Romance,' were distributed.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1934, episcopal chairman Joseph Schrembs was replaced by John F. Noll of Fort Wayne while the Knights of Columbus (KC) contributed a $3,000 annual pledge to support The Catholic Hour which now was on 50 stations. The 300th program was broadcast on November 24, 1935 and the annual audience mail was nearly 23,000 letters. Apologetics work continued, both with the radio hour and in the field nationally with fostering and promoting evidence work.  In 1928, there were 1216 affiliates, with 12 national, 5 state or regional, 389 parish councils, 418 KC councils, 225 Holy Name societies, and 167 other local societies.  The number of radio stations carrying the Catholic Hour reached 75 in 40 states, with nearly 42,000 items of mail received with about 39, 000 related to the Catholic Hour, with 8,000 from non-Catholics, including the claim of twelve conversions directly traceable to the program. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1940, the NCCM and The Catholic Hour noted their twentieth and tenth respective anniversaries. The world's first Catholic television program 'The Spiritual Symbolism of Television' with Fulton J. Sheen was telecast on Easter Sunday, March, 24, 1940. The NCCM began to support the Bishops Welfare Emergency Relief Committee (BWERC) and the National Office for Decent Literature (NODL) in 1942 and the apostolic Narberth Movement in 1943. In 1944, The Catholic Hour was credited with 37 conversions while NCCM began a second show called the Hour of Faith, described as a "chatty, carpet-slipper sort of talk in a musical setting that should be neither high-brow nor stiffly religious." In 1945, the number of affiliates was 24 diocesan councils, 8 national organizations, 1515 parish councils (including 1,168 KC), 541 Holy Name Societies, and 174 miscellaneous local organizations. The Catholic Hour had 106 stations and an audience mail of 123,000.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1949, The Catholic Hour had 127 radio stations and 88,642 pieces of audience mail. The NCCM also began experimenting with television with Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen's Easter Special. In 1950, Martin Work became Executive Secretary, a position he would hold until 1970. In 1951, The Catholic Hour moved time slots to 2:00 p.m. from 6:00 p.m. and saw a station increase to 144 and received 78,063 pieces of mail. In 1952, the NCCM took part in assisting the Congressional Committee Investigating Indecent Literature led by Congressman E.C. Gathings of Arkansas. The Catholic Hour, now a half hour program (2-2:30 on Sundays), was carried on 143 stations, and also heard on the Armed Forces Radio Network. The Catholic Hour also debuted on television with 62 stations by the end of 1952. It won an award as the finest network religious television program for 1952-1953 by the Ohio Institute for Education by Radio and Television. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Catholic Hour celebrated its 25th year on radio in 1955, with 143 stations, while The Catholic Hour on television increased to 85 stations and a main television office for NCCM was opened in New York City.  By 1957, there were 16 national organizations, 1,344 parish and KC councils, and 24 regional councils. The Catholic Hour on Radio had 144 stations with 3 million listeners and The Catholic Hour on television had 120 stations and an audience of 2 million people. In 1958, on television The Catholic Hour produced an award winning two hour special on the history of the Catholic Church. In 1960, the NCCM and The Catholic Hour turned 40 and 30 years old respectively. Radio-TV broadcasting had an increase of 20 percent with much of it going to religious specials such as 'The Living Church' program on television, and negotiations with ABC began for bringing Catholic programming to its network.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1961, federal aid for education was the main social issue while on television a notable program on ABC titled 'Directions '61' discussed the religious factor in the 1960 presidential election that resulted in the first Catholic, John F. Kennedy, becoming president. In 1962, The Catholic Hour focused radio broadcasts on racism in America and youth issues, with the highlight on television being a special on America and Communism and prejudice. Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Hogan wrote 'The Saintmaker's Christmas Eve' on ABC and Christmas Mass on radio. In 1963, there were a total of 7,274 organizations affiliated with the NCCM, including 66 diocesan councils and 21 national organizations. The NCCM provided staff for the Conference on Religion and Race in response to heightened racial tensions while The Catholic Hour on radio focused on the history of ecumenical councils and on television discussed the actual Second Vatican Council. Additionally, Martin Work led an NCCM delegation that met with President Kennedy at The White House.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1964, there was an increase in affiliates with 7,987, with national councils staying stagnant and a decrease in state councils. Radio and television programming focused on the theme of new pope Paul VI building a bridge to the contemporary world. Race in America and Latin American issues also became a focus on radio programs such as 'Catholics in Action' and on other television documentaries. In 1965, affiliates were at 7,852 with 35 councils for the Military Councils of Catholic Men due to the escalation of the War in Vietnam. A new diocesan council plan was also created to compete with the changing times.  In 1966, television and radio highlights included a CBS special titled 'An American Perspective' that gave an oversight on the Second Vatican Council.  In 1967, there was an increased focus on adult education and poverty outreach programs. There were 59 television programs, with the most popular being The Catholic Hour's special on 'The Church and War' dealing with the Vietnam War.  Of the 100 radio programs the most notable was a ten part series titled, 'The Perplexed Catholic: A Guide through Confusion' that looked at the effects of the Vatican Council decrees. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1968, the NCCM produced 52 television and 130 radio programs; however, differences with the bishops resulted in the end of an era with all programs ceasing as of December 31, 1968 when the New York offices were closed, staff terminated, and files turned over to the new National Catholic Office for Radio and Television (NCORT). The final Catholic Hour programs included 'Faith in God and Man' and perhaps its best program in decades on radio or television, "Sing Freedom,' a tribute to the life of Martin Luther King Jr. As NCCM's fiftieth anniversary approached in 1970, there were efforts to understand the complex issues of changing times and to find a new role for the NCCM.  A conference was held in Washington with ten other lay organizations to discuss lay cooperation in running parishes in the future, and, most importantly, a joint committee with the NCCW recommended a merger as a way to promote greater lay unity. However, the resulting National Council of Catholic Laity (NCCL) proved to be a brief union that ended in 1975 when the NCCM gave up the ghost and the NCCW went its own way thereafter.

          <h3>
            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The records of the National Council of Catholic Men (NCCM), while not constituting a particularly large collection in terms of linear feet, is nevertheless an important and fairly detailed documentation of NCCM history via a wide variety of formats. There are constitutions, bylaws, certificates of incorporation, minutes and related material of the Board of Directors, annual reports, convention proceedings, correspondence, Catholic Hour radio and television material, audio tapes, phonographs, photographs, publications, and a scrapbook of news clippings. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The first series is Constitutions, By-laws, and Incorporation Records, dated 1947-1970 and located in box 1. This material consists of legal documents that governed the operations of NCCM throughout much of its existence though unfortunately they do not include foundational documents from 1920 nor anything related to their disbandment in 1975. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series is Golden Jubilee Files, 1920-1962 and 1970, in boxes 1-2. This material includes older NCCM files gathered together by those preparing for the NCCM's 50th anniversary even as it prepared to merge with the National Council of Catholic Women (NCCW) to form the NCCL, and, ironically, just five short years away from the NCCM's ultimate demise.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series is Board of Directors' Executive Committee Correspondence, Minutes and Related Material, 1920-1969, in boxes 2-7. This consists of bound volumes, often overlapping in date span, as well as copies of minutes and related items in traditional file folders. There are gaps in the files for the 1930s and most of the 1940s and 1950s though fortunately these years are covered in the bound volumes.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fourth series is Annual Reports, 1920-1969, in boxes 8-9. There is a bound volume for the years 1932-1946, with the other years in file folders. These consist of both typescript and printed copies. In order to have a complete run certain years are photocopies made of originals from the Bishops' Conference Executive Department/Office of the General Secretary. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fifth series is Convention Files, dated 1922, 1927-1933, 1951-1969, in boxes 9-12. As the sporadic dates indicate there are many gaps with not much from the earliest years. What is there is often just a print copy of some of the sermons and addresses and not proceedings or other more substantial files. The conventions were held annually from 1920 to 1955 and biennially from 1957 to 1969. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The sixth series is Correspondence and Related Material, 1935(1948-1975)1975, in boxes 12-36, and further subdivided into seven sub-series. The first sub-series is Officers and Board Members, 1950-1971, in boxes 12-14. These are mostly alphabetical files relating to various NCCM board members, presidents like John Donnelly or Nunzio Giambalvo, and the bishop's conference episcopal chairman such as Leo Binz of St. Paul. The second sub-series is the National Consultants Program,  1951(1967-1970)1970, in boxes 15-18. These files are also mostly alphabetical by surname but incomplete with only names beginning with A to G included. The third sub-series is affiliated National Organizations, 1949-1974, in boxes 19-21. The fourth is Non-affiliated National Organizations, 1935(1948-1974)1974, in boxes 22-24. The fifth is Diocesan, 1939(1951-1975)1975, in boxes 24-34. This subseries includes both general files and alphabetical files by diocesan name. The sixth is Pastoral Councils, 1963-1972, in boxes 34-35. The seventh and final subseries is Miscellaneous, 1957-1973, in boxes 35-36. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The seventh series is Catholic Hour Records, 1929-1968, in boxes 36-46. There are three sub-series. The first is Executive Committee Files, 1929-1968, in boxes 36-39. This includes materials on the founding of the radio hour in 1930 as well as the demise of both the television and radio shows in 1968. The records are rich though incomplete and include correspondence, meeting minutes, scripts, and publicity files. The second sub-series is Scripts and Transcripts, 1930-1968, in boxes 39-46, and has printed radio transcripts filed alphabetically by speakers' name as well as television transcripts printed in both newsletter format and typescript copies, both filed chronologically. The third subseries is Printed Material, 1934-1946, in box 46, which has printed items commemorating so many years of The Catholic Hour being on the air or miscellaneous topics. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The eight series is General Publications and Printed Material 1924-1969, in boxes 47-48.
This is a miscellaneous selection of surviving general publications and printed material issued by the NCCM. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The ninth series, Scrapbook of Clippings, 1930-1931, in Box 49, has news clippings from the NCCM conventions in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1930 and Rochester, New York, in 1931.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The tenth and last series is Audio Visual Records, 1930-1970, in boxes 50-53 and divided into there are three sub-series. The first is Phonographs, 1938-1941, in box 50, which consists of recording from The Catholic Hour on radio. There are seven 33 1/3 and four 78 rpm phonographs. The second is Photographs, 1930-1970, in boxes 50-51. This includes oversize photos and topics run from general matters to events such as conventions and endeavors such as The Catholic Hour on television in the 1960s. Of particular note is a photo of the NCCM delegation led by Martin Work that was hosted at The White House by President Kennedy in 1963. The third and last sub-series is Audio Tapes, 1966-1968, in boxes 52-53. The tape labels do not state whether the recordings are the radio or television versions of The Catholic Hour. Listening to a sample suggests they are the masters, without edits made for broadcasting, which include some mistakes and re-reading of sections. In most cases, in both radio and early television, the pre-recorded introductions or closings were added at the time of editing. However, it would appear that these recordings are for the radio show as the sound engineers or editors occasionally buzz in and interrupt the speaker with questions or instructions. They also discuss recording levels at the beginning and there are occasions when one hears someone open and close a door while walking away from the microphone, suggesting the recording is taking place in a separate room, most likely in a separate recording booth. Therefore, these are most likely recordings for the radio broadcasts though not copies that were aired.      </p>
