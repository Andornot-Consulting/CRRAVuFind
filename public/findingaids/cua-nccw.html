          <h3>
            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The National Council of Catholic Women was established on March 4, 1920, under the guidance of John Burke, as an initiative of the Lay Organizations Department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference (NCWC).  Burke wrote a letter to the 114 bishops of the United States, and requested that they each send one to three women diocesan representatives.  Nearly two hundred women gathered that first weekend, and officially voted on the constitution and the executive committee.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">As the first federation of Catholic women's organizations, the NCCW was able to provide a unified voice for the thousands of independent Catholic women's organizations that existed in the United States, to offer resources for united actions, to ensure official Catholic representation in national movements, and to stimulate the local efforts of the women's organizations.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">NCCW has operated under an Executive Director and a Board of Directors, first under the auspices of the NCWC, and then from 1966 until the present as an association within the National Council of Catholic Bishops.  From 1920 until 1966, the primary role of the NCCW was to act a spokespeople and volunteers in the Catholic Action Projects.  After the Second Vatican Council decree granted them association status, the organization embarked on a renewed course of action, set by the guidelines of the Second Vatican Council to the Church at large, and focusing on contemporary societal issues for Catholic women. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The organization managed the National Catholic School of Social Service (NCSSS), 1921-1947, for women, prior to its merger with the School of Social Work, for men, at The Catholic University of America.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Throughout the tenure of this organization, a primary focus has been the study and promotion of Catholic principles through a system of national committees which guide their counterparts on the diocesan and parish level. These committees included Home and School Association, Immigration, Social Action, Rural Life, and many others.  Working with the groups on a regional and local level, the groups were able to publish a variety of informational kits to help these organizations train participants and get national recognition and help.   Through the National Home and School Association, the organization published and distributed materials to educators and members, and supported several publications and newsletters, including the Catholic School Journal, the Catholic High School Quarterly, Crossroads, Docete, and their own NHSS Bulletin.  This branch of the organization was also tasked with arranging the Family Life Conventions, and supporting the popular Catholic Hour radio show of the NCCW's fraternal organization, the National Council of Catholic Men.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">NCCW was involved with and in several national and international organizations, most dealing with social issues such as poverty, the status of woman, the racial divide, health and education concerns, and Native American life educational programs.  Their national and international information Kits were used in convention meetings and study clubs throughout the world.  They were instrumental in facilitating the Job Corps and WICS programs in the United States.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Some of their publications include Monthly Message, 1929-1963; WORD, 1964-1971; Catholic Women, 1975-2000; Colloquy, 1988-1993; and Bulletin Board, 1994-1998.  They also spearheaded and supported publications from commissions that operated under the guidance of NCCW including; Church Community Commission Newsletter; Community Affairs Commission Newsletter; the International Affairs Commission Newsletter; the Family Affairs Commission Newsletter; and the News of the Hill Newsletter.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The NCCW celebrated their 75th anniversary in 1995 by commissioning Ruth O'Halloran to write a history of the organization, and this work remains the only major source of information on the foundation and expansion of NCCW.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The National Convention took place annually from 1920 until 1942, when the delegates elected to host the event every two years.  NCCW continues to hold biennial national conventions, assemblies, and regional training institutes.  It provides representation for American Catholic women at national and international meetings concerned with the moral and religious welfare, and produces numerous publications, including the monthly magazine Catholic Woman and various news sheets.

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 1: Administrative History (1918-1970) contains records, meeting minutes, and historical documents relating to the foundation and expansion of the organization.

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 5: The National Home and School Service was an independent association affiliated with the NCWC, NCCW, and the NCCM that began in 1948 and is still in existence within the NCEA. This organization advocated for an educational partnership between Parents, Students, and Educators in Catholic Schools. This partnership was mainly to reinforce lessons from the classroom in the home, as well as to educate students in proper Catholic values in the home and at school. This series contains correspondence with the NCCW as well as form letters sent to parents and educators within the Catholic School system. There are also publications concerning the service as well as different movements this service advocated; which included funding for Catholic Schools and governmental aid to youth programs. Lastly, there are newsletters and bulletins released by the National Home and School Service.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 6: National Organization Affiliations (1964-1969) is divided into two sub-series. The first subseries have extensive files on the Women in Community Service Organization. This was an independent organization affiliated with the NCCW and several other women's organizations such as the NCJW, NCNW, and the UCW. The main goal of this organization was to combat poverty through faith based organizations and collaboration with the US Job Corps and the US Office of Economic Development. This organization also was heavily involved with advocating women's rights, in particular a fair wage and equal hiring. Lastly, the second sub-series are files on the NCCW involvement with the national school lunch program, and a study conducted with the US government from 1968-1969.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 7: International Organization Affiliations (1919-1984) is divided into seven sub-series. It contains information pertaining to NCCW's involvement with and in international organizations. Materials include invitations, programs, personal correspondence, personal observations, proposal drafts, telegrams, news releases, newspaper clippings, resolution and position papers, paper drafts, and reports outlining education and health concerns in the individual countries under consideration. Some of the main highlights from this series are files from Latin American Catholic Women Groups from the 1920s-1960s. Most of these groups advocated for family values and for an end to religious persecution, in particular in Mexico during the 1920s. Also, there are files on different Catholic family organizations, and peace movements in Europe from the 1920s-1930s. Lastly, there are files on international youth organizations and partnering with Catholic Charities internationally.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 8: Publications, Form Letters and Information Kits (1919-2000) is divided into two sub-series. This two-part series contains publications distributed by committees and commissions that seem to be under the umbrella or direct supervision of NCCW offices, as well as notebooks of form letters distributed by NCCW, and copies of Information Kits that were used in convention meetings and study clubs. The first sub-series contains NCCW Publications and Information Kits. The NCCW publications include Monthly Message, 1929-1963; WORD, 1964-1971; Catholic Women, 1975-2000; Colloquy, 1988-1993; and Bulletin Board, 1994-1998.  It also includes Form Letters, 1963-1969 and several Handbooks and Information Kits, 1966-1992. The second sub-series contains publications from commissions that operated under the guidance of NCCW including; Church Community Commission Newsletter; Community Affairs Commission Newsletter; the International Affairs Commission Newsletter; the Family Affairs Commission Newsletter; and the News of the Hill Newsletter. The News of the Hill Newsletter documentation includes correspondence regarding its origins as well as research materials used to create working drafts of the newsletter.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 9: Audiovisual Materials contains photographs, Kodak slides, lantern slides, reel to reel audio tape, cassette tapes, and VHS Tapes. The photographs chronicle the history of the NCCW through past conventions, past national officers and presidents, and different events they have sponsored. There are however two boxes of rolled photographs that are brittle from the earliest history of the organization. The Kodak slides and lantern slides are from events from the 1950s-1960s. Lastly the audio and video items are from national conventions from 1965-1997.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 10: Diocesan Affiliate Card Files (c. 1940-1960) contains rolodex-type cards that are bundled by region and diocese. The information available on each card varies, but the listed categories are contact name, address, phone number, number of members, dues, diocese name, etc.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 11: Scrapbooks is a collection of clippings from past national conventions and general news about the NCCW from 1925-1968. There are also some clippings of the history of the order from 1917-1986. </p>

          <p>The National Home and School Service was an independent association affiliated with the NCEA, NCWC, NCCW, and the NCCM that began in 1948 and is still in existence within the NCEA. This organization advocated for an educational partnership between Parents, Students, and Educators in Catholic Schools. This partnership was mainly to reinforce lessons from the classroom in the home, as well as to educate students in proper Catholic values in the home and at school. This series contains correspondence with the NCCW as well as form letters sent to parents and educators within the Catholic School system. There are also publications concerning the service as well as different movements this service advocated; which included funding for Catholic Schools and governmental aid to youth programs. Lastly, there are newsletters and bulletins released by the National Home and School Service.</p>
