            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The National Federation of Catholic College Students, NFCCS, was a lay student organization that began in 1937 and folded in 1967. This organization was mainly concerned with expressing student grievances at Catholic colleges regarding international issues as well as defending political movements in the name of social justice. The main aim of the organization was to recognize that Catholic Colleges were isolated on issues concerning religious, political, economic, and social issues in society. The organization was to foster leadership amongst men and women at Catholic Colleges to defend the positions of the Church. Until 1955 the organization worked directly under the National Catholic Welfare Conference, NCWC, after 1955 the NFCCS worked with the NCEA national Chaplain to work on issues of social justice.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The height of NFCCS was 1955-1966 with their involvement in racial and social justice. Much of these issues were dealt with at the National Congress which was held every year. These National Congresses served as an outlet for all the regional chapters of the NFCCS to meet and deal with Church policy ranging from international affairs to liturgical policy. Another function of the NFCCS was to defend academic freedom on Catholic College campuses as defined by Cardinal Newman on his definition on a Catholic College/University. The organization went into decline following the passage of much of the Civil Rights and "Great Society" policies due to the dissatisfaction with the organizations lack of enthusiasm for protesting and working outside the rigid regional setup of the organization.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Most of the correspondence is from Rev. Eugene Dehner (1914-2004), a biology professor at the Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas.  He earned his bachelor's degree at St. Benedict's College and his master's and doctorate at Cornell University.  In 1935 he became a monk at St. Benedict's Abbey and finished his theological training and was ordained in 1940. His teaching career began in 1946 where he became involved in many student activities including the NFCCS. His involvement led to his elevation as moderator, the NFCCS term for president, for the mid-west region of the NFCCS for 1955-1961. For the following two years Dehner was the national chaplain and was instrumental in the fight for social justice, in particular interracial harmony. Overall, the Dehner correspondence shows the dedication and involvement of Catholic College students working with the church to fight for the major political causes of the 1950's and 1960's. </p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The National Federation of Catholic College Students moderator records consist of five series. The first series is a box of personal correspondence of Rev. Eugene Dehner with other Catholic organizations, colleges, and universities while he was moderator for the Midwest region and national chaplain. There is also correspondence with other moderators during the National Congress Sessions that Dehner attended, 1955-1964. The second series is a box of correspondence and publications on Interracial Justice, 1963-1966. There are also minutes and booklets from the 1964-1966 Interracial Justice conferences. These booklets include the congressional record on major civil rights legislation. Lastly, there is a complete report done by the NFCCS for the government on "Desegregation of Health and Medical Services in the Border States".</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series are two boxes on the NFCCS annual National Congress Conference, 1955-1964. These conferences were when all the regions of the NFCCS met to discuss issues within the Church and issues concerning academic freedom. This series includes a pamphlet from each year's conference as well as minutes and committee reports from each year's congress. The fourth series is a box of the NFCCS National Congress correspondence from 1955-1964. This correspondence is between the NCWC and the regional moderators and their positions on issues during the convention. The final series of this collection are three boxes of NFCCS reports and publications. These reports are on different committee findings on international issues such as the Church in Latin-America, poverty in Africa, and building universities in the third world. The pamphlets consist of general information on the NFCCS for new College chapters as well as pamphlets on social issues and the organization's position on different social policies. Overall, this collection gives good insight into the politics of American Catholic college students during the late 1950's and early 1960's.</p>
