          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Father Valentine "Val" Peter was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1934.  He earned doctorate degrees in both canon law and theology from Gregorian University, University of St. Thomas, and Lateran University, all in Rome.  He was ordained in 1959, and attended the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.  After returning to America, by 1969, he was building homes in the Johnson War on Poverty under Section 234 and 235 of the Great Poverty Act with HUD (Housing and Urban Development) funds.  He then became involved with Boys Town, an orphanage that promoted "help, hope and healing" for abused, abandoned, and neglected children.  During his tenure, he expanded the mission to be called Boys and Girls Town and helped 43,000 children at 19 sites in 15 states, as well as Washington, DC.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1984, he received The Archbishop Daniel E. Sheehan award, which recognizes priests and brothers who have been outstanding leaders in their communities in Nebraska.   Some of his other awards and distinctions include: Who's Who in America; presidential award from the National Association of Homes and Services for Children in 1999; Nebraska Foundation's 2007 Nebraskalander of the Year, and the 2000 Wallenberg Humanitarian Award (New York Chapter). He also served as the associate pastor of Dowd Chapel, Boys Town, NE, He served as the fourth Executive Director of Boys Town, from June 15, 1985, until his retirement on July 1, 2005.  Peter also served on the boards or committees of more than 20 national and local organizations. In 2009, he was banned from visiting inmate Tracey Dyess in a women's prison in Iowa.  He had been counseling her since her imprisonment in 2005 for killing her sister and brother in a fire, which intended to kill her step-father, who allegedly abused the children.  Peter was banned from counseling her after he refused to surrender notes from a visit, and then ate part of his notes and shredded the rest.  Since his retirement, he continues to write for a number of publications, as well as contributes to some online editorials.

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Val J. Peter - Vatican II collection consists of the documents he acquired during the preparation for and convening of the Second Vatican Council.  Peter's collection includes the public documents from a variety of the commissions, including on ecumenism, the role of the laity, and the Church in the Modern World.  His collection also reveals more about what it entailed to stay in Rome during the Council.  He kept hotel information, newspapers from Vatican City, and the contact information to reach other participants.  Peter also kept programs from various masses he attended, as well as encyclicals and sermons, and even a program from an opera that participants of the Council attended.  Those particular materials iterate that the Council was more than solely focused on clarifying church doctrine; it was about building a community among the participants.  He also kept pamphlets concerning the use of communication - which was one of the major legacies of the Council.  It became increasingly evident that in order to reach out to the laity, it was necessary to turn to effective and popular forms of media, such as the radio.  The National Catholic Welfare Conference convened and received literature on effective broadcasting. Other notes show that the National Catholic Welfare Conference also convened to discuss several schemata, and admitted several new countries to the International Committee.  Rev. Val Peter also kept some blank copies of emendation forms: these would have been circulated among participants when discussing various schema and proposed changes. </p>
