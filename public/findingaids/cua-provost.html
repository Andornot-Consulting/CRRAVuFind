            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Born on October 15, 1939 in Washington, D.C., Reverend James Harrison Provost was an internationally renowned canonist and professor. After completing undergraduate studies at Carroll College in Helena, Montana receiving degrees in philosophy and mathematics, Provost went on to pursue theological studies at The Catholic University of Louvain where he was ordained a priest in 1963 and earned his S.T.B. and M.A. degrees. In 1967, Rev. Provost received his doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome graduating summa cum laude. Upon his return to the United States, he served as chancellor and officialis for the Diocese of Helena from 1967 until 1979 when he joined the faculty of canon law at The Catholic University of America. Throughout his service to the Church, Rev. Provost was an active member of the Canon Law Society of America (CLSA) of which he served as president from 1977 to 1978 and as executive coordinator from 1980 to 1986. He also participated in many committees and synods regarding church issues. While on the faculty of canon law at CUA, Rev. Provost served as managing editor for The Jurist, the only journal published in the United States dedicated to the study and promotion of canon law, from 1980 until his untimely death on August 26, 2000. Rev. Provost had been struggling with Crohns' disease and died at a local hospital after suffering from a respiratory arrest.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Rev. Provost studied Church law during an exciting time for canonists as Pope John XXIII called for the Code of Canon Law to be updated. Canonists had to undertake a new task: consider what the law of the Church might and should be instead of simply interpreting the law. Because Rev. Provost "had the great and rare fortune to become a canonist at a time when Church law was undergoing renewal and reform," he not only interpreted the law but always considered what Church law should be. During his more than thirty-five years of writing, Rev. Provost addressed numerous difficult questions from abortion to the role of the laity and even to the reorganization of the Roman Curia.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">While he proved to be a prolific writer and an expert on Church law, Rev. Provost's writings were called into question during his two-year long battle for tenure at the Vatican chartered Catholic University of America. Under university bylaws, a teacher must be granted tenure within seven years or leave the school. In addition, if the candidate is a member of an ecclesiastical faculty, namely that of philosophy, canon law, and theology, he or she must be granted a nihil obstat (no objection) from the episcopal members of the CUA Board of Trustees. Deviating from the established procedures, Archbishop of Washington and therefore CUA Chancellor ex officio James A. Hickey sent Provost's application to the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education. A year later, the Vatican returned the tenure review to the episcopal members of the CUA Board of Trustees without recommendation but did raise some issues regarding Provost's ecclesiology. In published works, Provost has asserted that the Catholic Church "discriminates" against women since they cannot enter the priesthood. In addition, Vatican officials questioned his writings regarding the role of the laity in the Church, the issue of First Penance before First Communion, the "death of marriage" concept, the "internal forum solution" in regards to divorced and remarried Catholics, the use of dispensed priests under the 1971 norms, and the role of dissent in the Catholic Church. Despite receiving a unanimous vote of approval from each evaluating bodies in the Department of Canon Law, in the School of Religious Studies, and in the University, Rev. Provost was denied the nihil obstat on June 2, 1986.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Following a proposal submitted by the Committee on Appointments and Promotions of the School of Religious Studies, Rev. Provost and Archbishop Hickey released a joint statement on August 26, 1986. According to the statement, the nihil obstat "does not mean that the bishops of the Board of Trustees necessarily agree with all the expressed canonical opinions of [Rev. Provost]." Rev. Provost also agreed to publish clarifying articles and revise some of his writings since "his published opinions may need to be changed upon further study." Shortly after the statement was released, the episcopal members of the Board of Trustees reversed its previous decision and granted the nihil obstat. On August 28, the full board approved the conferral of continuous tenure upon Fr. Provost by mail ballot. The Provost case contrasted sharply with that of Charles E. Curran, another member of the Catholic University theology faculty who refused to retract certain statements he had made regarding sexual morality. However, in a self-proposed compromise, Father Curran agreed to stop teaching sexual ethics at the university.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The following year after Rev. Provost was granted tenure, he was named chairman of the university's canon law department. Rev. Provost continued to teach at CUA until 1999, completing 20 years of service to the Church and school.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The James H. Provost Papers, divided into 4 series, documents the life of a renowned canonist and professor who faithfully served the Church until his untimely death at age 60 in 2000. Focusing on his controversial battle for tenure at The Catholic University of America, the papers also give insight into the important work Reverend Provost undertook regarding the interpretation and execution of Church law. The collection is subdivided into 4 series.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The first series, The Tenure Review Files, which documents Reverend Provost's two-year long controversial battle for tenure is divided into 3 subseries. Subseries 1, publications, contains two bound volumes of Reverend Provost's writings compiled for his tenure review process. The volumes contain 35 publications divided into 6 topics: Church governance issues, rights in the Church, the teaching office of the Church, canon law issues in ministry, the canon law on selected sacraments, and revision of the Code of Canon Law. Subseries 2, subject files, contains numerous files regarding the tenure review process from the Vatican, the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, the School of Religious Studies Committee on Academic Freedom, the School for Religious Studies Committee of Appointments and Promotions, and The Catholic University of America Board of Trustees. Found here are also the dubia and pro memoria from the Vatican detailing its objections to Reverend Provost's ecclesiology and a chronology of the tenure process put together by Father Provost. Subseries 3, correspondence, is organized by person and contains correspondence between Father Provost and University and Church officials, allowing a glimpse into the intricacies of the process.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series, Newspaper Articles and Press Releases, is arranged alphabetically by topic and contains several articles and press releases in which Father Provost appears regarding several Church issues. Journalist often sought the expertise of Reverend Provost on issues that ranged from abortion to theological dissent within the Church. Contained in this series are also news articles relating to his tenure battle and his death on August 26, 2000.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series, Synod and Committee Files, is arranged alphabetically by subject and contains several materials regarding synods and committees in which Reverend Provost participated. Spanning almost 30 years, these files reflect the issues the Church faced and documents her response. Found in this series are several documents from the Canon Law Society of America including the "Task Force Critiques of the Initial Schemata for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law." Symposium and committee topics range from marriage, the domestic Church, episcopal education, and Catholic education.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fourth series, Family and Personal Items, contains 6 personal items of Reverend Provost giving an insight into his private life. Found in this series is his doctoral diploma from the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome from which he graduated summa cum laude and awards given to him by the Canon Law Society of America. There is also a photo album which contains several color and black and white prints from 1979-1992 and a folder containing genealogical materials on the Provost family. One item of interest in this series is a contract with himself, allowing an insight into how Reverend Provost wanted to live his personal life.</p>
