            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The history of the Ryan family in America begin with John, Charley, and Matthew Ryan who were Irish immigrants who were Massachusetts mill workers at the time of the beginning of this collection in 1827. The family immigrated to the United States a few years prior to this in Philadelphia. In 1836, Matthew and Charley Ryan moved to Norfolk, Virginia to begin working in the woolen industry. They would eventually run their own mill in Norfolk, and invested heavily in local railroads and canals. Also, in 1836 John Ryan and his family moved to Connecticut where he became invested in railroads, the New York Central, and the textile industry. The focus of the collection does move towards John Ryan during this period when he becomes actively involved in Connecticut Democratic Party politics and becomes involved with Irish Patriot Thomas D. McGee. For most of the 1840s John Ryan's textile business prospered and he and his family became part of a small group of Irish-American immigrants to enter the middle-class. In 1846 John Ryan started hiring predominately Irish immigrant labor, and also hired a close life long friend, Thomas Grey, who was also a staunch Irish patriot and involved in local Democratic Politics. In 1849 he and his wife lose their one year old son Charles, followed by their three year old son Thomas Michael to a fever.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The 1850s begins with John Ryan opening a four story mill in 1851 in Connecticut. Throughout the 1850s, John Ryan and his brothers remain staunch defenders of the Democratic Party and fall on the side of Stephen Douglas' wing of the party. In 1857 John Ryan begins a new career, after financial difficulty in Connecticut, in 1852-1853, in Norfolk Virginia with his brothers. His nephew George Ryan also begins his career as an officer in the United States Army this year. During the 1860 election the Ryan family is staunch supporters of Stephen Douglas' candidacy and the maintaining of the Union.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Civil War brought business uncertainty for John Ryan and George Ryan, of Virginia, becoming a Colonel in the Union Army instead of joining the Confederate Army. John weathers the 1861 fiscal year and is able to maintain his industries in Norfolk and Connecticut for the meantime. Also, during the war John Ryan moves to Decatur, Illinois and George Ryan is in the western theatre of the war in Tennessee. In 1864 Matthew Ryan becomes a soldier in the Union Army and George Ryan dies May 8 at the Battle of Spotsylvania. The end of the war in 1865 brought Matthew Ryan a new wife, Nancy Lawrence.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1866 John Ryan and Matthew Ryan's family relocate from Illinois to St. Louis Missouri. They still maintain their previous antebellum industries however. During the early 1870s Matthew Ryan partners with his wife's brother, Nat Lawrence, to begin a successful logging company in Southern Illinois. During the 1876 election John Ryan is heavily involved in the Missouri campaign for Samuel Tilden and the Democratic Ticket because of a promise of a large political appointment if the Democrats had won. In 1880, after several years of declining health, Matthew and Charles Ryan die in Norfolk, Virginia. They had relocated back to Norfolk following the end of Reconstruction. John Ryan dies in 1887, ending the first generation of Ryan's in America.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> The rest of the collection focuses on Matthew and John's sons, mainly Matt Ryan and the Lawrence family. During the 1890s, Mat becomes heavily invested in gold and silver mining and becomes even more wealthy then his father and his uncles. By the 1920s the only family left in Norfolk Virginia is Augusta and Nancy Lawrence; during this time she begins to compile the Ryan/Lawrence family histories. This genealogy would taper off with the death of this second generation in the 1930s-1940s. In 1970, Susan Ryan turned over the family papers, in St. Louis Missouri to Jerome Goeber, her great-nephew, who spent the next twenty-two years organizing and writing a history of the Ryan family. This project was completed by Goeber in 1992. Overall, the Ryan family is an example of an Irish-American family who rose to become influential in business and politics during nineteenth century America.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Ryan Family Papers consists of two series of family correspondence, primarily dated 1827-1951, organized by Jerome Goebel in 1992. This twenty year personal project concluded with a four-hundred page synopsis of each of the 1200 letters given in the collection. All of the letters are arranged in alphabetical order and have a typed copy with the original letter as well. The main content of the letters are family correspondence and with business partnerships and investments in railroads and textile mills in Connecticut, New York, Missouri, and Illinois. Overall, there are 739 letters with different businesses associated with the family. The majority of the papers are from John Ryan who was a mill worker in Massachusetts. He had moved from Philadelphia, and was also in the Army during the Civil War. The family had several members in the family that were career army men during the antebellum period. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">There is correspondence with various political figures; the Ryan family were prominent Philadelphia and Connecticut Democrats during the Antebellum Period and during the Civil War. John Ryan was a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party retaking Congress in 1874, and was an important fundraiser for Samuel Tilden in Missouri during the 1876 Presidential Election. The papers also include newspaper clippings on different family members, land deeds, and United States Army Documents. Lastly, there are some letters that do mention new Irish Immigrants that the members of the Ryan family helped, with a job or financially, during the 1840s-1850s. Most of the political correspondence pertains to tariff issues, the Ryans were involved in the textile industry, and railroads. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Civil War correspondence is with John Ryan and other members of the Ryan family who were in the Union Army. This is fairly interesting because it gives insight to how upper-middle class Irish-American viewed the war. The rest of the correspondence following the death of John Ryan and his generation in 1887 saw a decline in the number of letters. There are only seventy-six letters from 1900-1943 and one booklet of a family history from 1951. These letters are lergely general family correspondence, but also includes correspondence concerning genealogical research on the Ryan family, as well as the history of Irish discrimination in America. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Overall, this collection is a great window into a rare well to do and politically connected Irish-American Family, as well as an insight into Irish-American political leanings from ca. 1830-1900. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series consists of family documents such as John Ryan's postmaster commission by President Andrew Johnson and George Ryan's Army Commission.</p>
