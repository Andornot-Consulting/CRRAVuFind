            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Smith was born in Saratoga N.Y. on September 22, 1855 to Bernard Smith and Mary Reilly-Smith and was baptized on December 17, 1855 at St. Peters Church. He was educated in the schools of the Christian Brothers in Albany, N.Y. and studied divinity at St. Michael's College in Toronto, Canada. He received his LL. D. from Mount St. Mary's College and from Notre Dame University. He was then ordained to the priesthood on July 17, 1881 and appointed assisted pastor of St. Patrick's Watertown, N.Y. In his youth the physicians had discovered in him a marked tendency to tuberculosis and prescribed life in the pine woods and sleeping in a tent. So, when he was not content with the labors of his parish, he became a missionary in the Adirondack region and was well known by the woodsmen and lumberjacks. In 1883 he was made pastor at Rouse's Point and subsequently held an office in the diocese of Ogdensburg. In 1888 he succeeded Patrick Valentine Hickey, the editor and founder of the Catholic Review of New York, for 3-4 years. He established The Boys Camp in Cliff Haven in 1898 as an adjunct to The Catholic Summer School of America, one of the first recreation camps for youth.  He was also the president and a trustee of The Catholic Summer School at Cliff Haven. Smith wrote to Thomas Joseph Shahan as well as James McMahon regarding The Catholic Summer School of America which also involved Edward Aloysius Pace. Bishop Henry Gabriels gave Smith a leave of absence from his parish at Rouse Point and then assigned him as chaplain to the Christian Brothers at De La Salle Institute. This is where he was the close friend of Brother Azarias, whose life he wrote. After many years he was the chaplain of the Sisters of Mercy in the Metropolis and in 1909 the pastor of the suburban parish of Dobbs Ferry. His love for theater inspired him to be a member of the Actors' Church Alliance and organized the Catholic Actors' Guild of America with the co-operation of Cardinal Farley in 1914. He was a treasurer and advisor up until the time of his death. He also a founder and chaplain of the Catholic Writers Guild of America in 1919. He was associated with Notre Dame University, Indiana as a professor and gave lectures on literature. In addition, he was also the cousin of Patrick J. McCormick who was the rector of Catholic University at the time. Within the last year of his life, his health began to fail and was required to go to New York for hospital care. He died at Misericordia Hospital from cancer at the age of 68 on September 24, 1923.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Smith published his first novel in 1880, 'A Woman of Culture,' and was soon followed by 'Solitary Island.' He was the author of 15 successful literary works and was a popular contributor to the Dublin Review, the Catholic World, the Ave Maria, The Columbiad, the Catholic Review of New York as well as other prominent Catholic journals. His time in the Adirondacks inspired 'Saranac' as well as a collection of short stories 'His Honor the Mayor.' Two more novels were completed, 'Art of Disappearing' which was reprinted under the title 'The Man Who Vanished' as well as 'The Black Cardinal.' 'The Prairie Boy,' 'The Boy Who Looked Ahead' and 'The Boy Who Came Back' and was inspired by the boys of Cliff Haven. Other works abut history and religion include a 'History of the Diocese of Ogdensburg,' 'History of the Diocese of New York, Life of Brother Azarias,' 'The Honor the Mayor and Other Tales,' 'The Training of a Priest' as well as two volumes of sermons, short stories, and plays. Frequently he used his inspiration from the outdoors, the Catholic faith, Irish-Americans and many social concerns especially labor relations, housing, as well as the theater. He also has a course of thirty lectures on the various forms of literature. For several years, he was the editor of The Catholic Review of Brooklyn, New York and until he neared the end of his life, a frequent contributor of daily papers, and special articles to newspapers and magazines.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Though Smith had a passion for theater, he lived during a time when there were tensions between the theater and the Catholic Church. Since 1866 the theater had been legislatively banned for the clergy and all but condemned for the Catholic laity. Smith published a theater column in the Catholic Review of New York in 1889, the first theater column in American Catholic publication, and it had some pushback. There were protests to Archbishop Corrigan and Corrigan instructed that Smith get rid of the column. Smith argued and claimed that all leading Catholic journals of Europe printed reviews. Smith would go and write about this tension this in the London Tablet. Afterwards, Corrigan instructed him to explain his reasons for creating and writing the theater column in an editorial and allowed him to continue the reviews in 'The Catholic Review.' This was the beginning of a change of attitude in America towards the stage from Puritan to Catholic.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">He was also very important in the organization of the Catholic Actors Guild of America. In 1912 at Walter Edmund Bentley's request, Smith was sent as a representative of the Roman Catholic Church was to the Actors Church Alliance of America. His illegal theater attendance had made him knowledgeable about the theater and thus he was chosen as the representative. However, the national council of the Actors Church Alliance of America would suggest that Smith establish a Roman Catholic branch. Catholic members instead decided to break off and found a new organization which was called the Catholic Actors Guild. Church law at the time dictated that clerics not attend theater and that people be warned away from it. Even Cardinal John Farley preferred that Smith not write about any public condemnations of the stage because it would easily influence the younger clergy to patronize the theater. Farley had difficult thinking of the theater as anything but an evil institution. Farley didn't want stage folk thinking that the Catholic Church now formally approves of things on stage.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Catholic Actors Guild was very unique Catholic community. The Catholic Actors Guild was dedicated to taking care of the religious needs of its members involved with the theater. The members were seen as individuals and the guild was in accord with Catholic discipline and morality. It easily charmed Catholic chaplains and theater people away from Bentley's interdenominational Actors Church Alliance of America. Smith eventually got Farley to approve of the Catholic Actors Guild under the direction of Eliza O'Brien Lummis. Smith also had St. Malachy's Church in Manhattan serve at the actors' church where there was a chaplain, mass held regularly, and a cemetery plot specifically for actors. In addition, there were funds available for actors, and the Guild even put on pageants to celebrate special events. Ironically, there was correspondence related to this topic of the theater that went missing and were later found, as well as some that were found torn and were in a wastebasket on campus.</p>
