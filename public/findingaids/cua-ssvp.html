            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded by Frederic Ozanam on April 23rd, 1833. The organization was formed a few years before by Ozanam and some of his friends at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he was studying law at the time. The roots of the society go back to a series of meetings known as the Conference of History. At one of these meetings, a student questioned Ozanam on what good the Catholic Church was actively performing in the present day. Following this encounter, Ozanam founded the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, with the assistance of Sister Rosalie Rendu, a Sister for the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. She became a mentor for Ozanam, as well as other early members of the society, by training them in social justice and care of the sick and poor.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The society was named after St. Vincent de Paul because of his commitment to charity and the care of the poor during the first half of the seventeenth century. He was the founder of the Confraternities of Charity and the Ladies of Charity, the order of which Sister Rendu was a member. Ozanam would contribute greatly to the first twenty years of the society with his writings on social justice, which became the modern encyclical on social justice. Ozanam died in 1853 and was beatified by Pope John Paul II on August 22, 1997 in Paris. Sister Rosalie Rendu died February 7, 1856 and was also beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2003.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Society of St. Vincent de Paul came to the United States in 1845, being first established in St. Louis, Missouri by Rev. John Timon, a Vincentian priest. Father Timon brought copies of the rule of the order from Dublin, Ireland, and began to discuss with local Catholics the importance of working with the poor. The then Bishop of St. Louis, Peter Richard Kenrick, asked Rev. Ambrose Heim to establish the society in St. Louis and for him to be its first spiritual advisor. The first meeting with its lay members took place on November 20, 1845. The first President was Dr. Moses Linton. The council was formally recognized by the International Council on February 2, 1846 in Paris.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The society grew greatly during the nineteenth century with diocesan councils being established across the nation. In 1853 New York City's first Society of St. Vincent de Paul Council was founded. During the twentieth century, the society continued to aid the poor but also began helping the poor in war-torn areas with its war relief programs. The National Council in the United States began sponsoring foreign Councils in third world countries with its twinning program during the 1970s-1990s. Long-serving executive secretary Dudley Baker served thirty years, from 1955-1985, and helped establish many modern charitable organizations. Baker not only aided several presidents during his tenure, but also helped to modernize the society in America. Tough the society in America has focused on disaster relief throughout its history, a greater emphasis has been placed on this recently, especially through the training of Rev. Ronald Ramson and the National Council's Charity Seminars.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is organized into five levels. The first level is the International Council in Paris, France that oversees the organization throughout the world. The second level is the National Council, which oversees each individual country's society. The third level is the Diocesan Councils, of which there are 51 in the United States that oversee individual Councils in the society. The fourth level is the District council which oversees all the individual conferences throughout the United States (there are 392 in this country). Lastly, at the fifth level are the conferences, of which there are 4,360 in the United States. Overall, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has continued to dedicate itself to charitable works for the poor throughout the United States and the world.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The National Council of the United States for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul contains eight series. The first is organizational files divided into five sub-series, with a total of eighteen boxes.

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fourth sub-series contain four boxes of international files concerning war relief to impoverished nations as well as a program known as twinning. Twinning is a program that sends aid to impoverished Society councils overseas, and is usually sponsored by an individual council in the United States, or in desperate cases, the entire national council. Also, the international files contain war relief files from post-war Japan with which the National Council was heavily involved. The last sub-series are Rev. Ronald Ransom's personal papers. Ransom is a chaplain from the national council who sponsors many charitable projects and runs the national council's charity school. Most of his files are manuscripts for sermons and correspondence.</p>

These materials are largely minutes, notes, and correspondence from committees that concern charitable programs, thrift stores, and disaster relief. There are also files from the homeless initiative committee meetings.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fourth series in this collection is comprised of nine boxes of general correspondence. These correspondence are from the national council, as well as from national officers such as President Joseph Mueller, executive secretary Dudley Baker and Rita Porter on internal business for the society. There is also correspondence concerning the planning of national meetings and charitable programs. These programs include nursing homes for the elderly, homeless shelters, and disaster relief. The fifth series is a twenty-seven box collection of publications. These publications vary from bound books of bulletins from the nineteenth century to pamphlets and magazines from the early twentieth century, and also vary in origin from the U.S. to Quebec, Canada and Dublin, Ireland. The books in this series are National Council bulletins, annual reports, and international council reports. Other books include biographies on founder Frederic Ozanam and St. Vincent de Paul, as well as different histories of individual councils.</p>

This includes annual reports from individual councils, for example New York, Washington DC, Chicago, etc. There are also national annual reports and informational booklets released by the council. There are also magazines and newspapers that are released from the American National Council as well as individual National Councils. The titles of these magazines includes; The Ozanam News and the VincenPaul Magazine. VincenPaul is the international magazine for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Lastly, there are Spanish and Italian Magazines for the Society. The sixth series are five boxes of files from the relief efforts of Hurricane Katrina. These relief services include financial records of donations from the National Council and individual councils. There are also financial reports from the National Council for relief services as well as coordination with other relief services such as the USCCB. Lastly, there are correspondences relating to relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, mainly with Roger Playwin and Rita Porter.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The seventh series contains nine boxes of audio-visual files. The videos in this series are mainly VHS tapes, but there is also one reel-to-reel tape and several DVDs. These videos are promotional material released by the national council as well as recruitment videos and recordings of national meetings. There are also cassette tapes of different addresses given by the national council on poverty and charitable works. This series also contains press releases from the national council. The photographs in this series originate mostly from annual national meetings and events around the United States that were placed in the national council magazine, The Ozanam News. Lastly, there are photos of the different charitable works done by individual councils.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The eighth series contains miscellaneous and oversized material, including oversized books and declarations in French from the international council in Paris. This series contains Society of St. Vincent de Paul medallions, prayer cards, coins, a box of miscellaneous memorabilia, and, notably, a photo from the 1904 national meeting in St. Louis.  The coins are from the one-hundredth anniversary of the Society in 1933 and depict either St. Vincent de Paul or Frederic Ozanam.
