            <a name="a2">Historical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The St. Vincent de Paul Society is an international charitable lay organization of the Catholic Church. It was founded on April 23, 1833 by Frédéric Ozanam, a student at the Sorbonne, along with five fellow students. They named their society after St. Vincent de Paul, d. 1660, the founder of the Congregation of the Mission and the Daughters of Charity, who was instrumental in training priests and ministering to the poor in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation.  Ozanam's purpose in founding the society was to assist the poor.  The society quickly spread throughout Europe and to America. In 1845, the first conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded at the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France in St. Louis, Missouri, after the rule of the society had been brought there from Ireland by a Vincentian priest.  The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul was first established in Washington D.C. at St. Matthew's Parish, in June 1859. The D.C. Society celebrates Union Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Julius P. Garesche, who had been raised and educated in St. Louis, as its founder.  Garesche was born in Cuba and immigrated with his parents to St. Louis at a young age, where he began his Catholic education.  He continued at Georgetown before he began attending West Point in 1837.  He graduated four years later, the only Catholic in his class, with high honors. After performing admirably in the Mexican War, he lived in Washington, D.C. as a staff member for the Adjutant General until the Civil War began.  He died in battle at Stones River, Tennessee on December 31, 1862. His funeral mass was held in Washington, D.C. at St. Aloysius Church and he was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The basic unit of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, both from an organizational and mission standpoint, begins at the parish level with a parish conference.  The society mimics the organization of the Catholic Church in general, as the next level of organization is the district councils, followed by the archdiocesan or diocesan councils, then the national council, and finally the Council General, located in Paris where the original society was founded.   When the St. Vincent de Paul Society was initially founded in the nation's capital, the city was still part of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, and it remained so until 1939. Until 1962, the four district councils in the archdiocese of Washington, the Washington Council, the Prince George's County Council, the Council of Southern Maryland, and the Montgomery County Council, were loosely organized under the direction of the President of the Society in Washington D.C. After 1962, a Central Council with a permanent office was organized to more effectively manage the affairs of the Society in the archdiocese of Washington.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The society was organized at the parish level so that its ideals of charitable assistance could be realized more effectively. The members of the society, men known as Vincentians, traveled in pairs to visit the materially and spiritually poor of their own parish, as well as work on special projects that might assist a larger group of people or a special cause, such as Christmas funds or orphanage relief. The Vincentians were never supposed to take care of someone's physical needs only without attempting to assuage their spiritual ones as well - their hope being that they would help the poor, as well as themselves, attain eternal salvation.  They would offer food and clothing to families, as well as rectifying Catholic marriages and ensuring that children were baptized and received religious education. This method, while very effective in the early and mid-nineteenth century, was challenged in that century's closing years and the early decades of the twentieth as charitable work became institutionalized and professionalized as social work.  The lay-volunteers and their institutions - including Vincentians and men and women who volunteered in other Catholic groups - found their leadership roles taken over by clerics, and the heavier oversight of their organizations by the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  This was not done specifically to take away lay control but to make the organizations more effective and bring them up to the welfare standards of the day.  By the beginning of World War II, many lay Catholic charitable organizations were functioning more effectively, but with two unforeseen effects: lay volunteers often abandoned traditional organizations and activities, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, because their roles were diminished, and many organizations had to change their way of operating so that they could continue to function in the new environment. The St. Vincent de Paul Society could not abandon their ideal of home visits, as this was necessitated by Frédéric Ozanam's rule for the society, but they could adapt in other areas, such as working in tandem with secular welfare societies.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Despite these changes, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul continued to maintain its importance to the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C.  Cardinal O'Boyle, the first resident archbishop, took an active interest in their mission, and they worked closely with the growing organization, Catholic Charities of Washington, D.C., and the government of Washington, D.C.  As reflected in the papers, throughout the middle decades of the twentieth century, the Washington, D.C. Vincentians strove to help all areas of the society, through small acts of charity towards needy families, to large, organized efforts at Christmas and in different group homes.  These documented efforts, while in many ways traditional, reflect the changes the twentieth century had wrought in the realm of charity and welfare.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Society of St. Vincent de Paul remains active in the archdiocese of Washington D.C. into the twenty-first century.</p>

          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This collection is divided into four series. The documents found in the first series cover all aspects of the administration and charitable activities of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Washington D.C.  It includes information about its early history, and contains annual reports, treasurer's reports, and directories.  The documents cover the research and decision to limit terms of office in the Central Council of the Society in the early 1950s, as well as the formation of a permanent office for the Central Council in 1962.  There are also annual reports from individual parish conferences, as well as aggregation applications. (Aggregation is the term used to indicate whether the Superior Council in Paris deemed a parish conference fully active and that they had satisfied the requirements to receive the full blessings and indulgences granted by the Pope.) Finally, there are many files that cover the charity efforts members and conferences of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul undertook in the middle decades of the twentieth century, including visits to orphanages, schools, work with disadvantaged and disabled men and women, fundraising, and some records of their traditional work - home visits within the parishes. The majority of documents are from the years 1947, when Archbishop and later Cardinal O'Boyle took residence in Washington, D.C., until the mid-1960's, after the Central Council was formed, although there are some documents that fall outside this range on either side.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The second series is a printed material series, and consists of annual reports from councils throughout the United States, and the rest of the world, as well as some histories of the Society from its founding in these areas, and some other related publications. These materials stretch from the late nineteenth-century until the mid-twentieth.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series is a memorabilia series, and consists of one medal commemorating the centennial of the death of Frédéric Ozanam, the founder of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fourth series, an audio-visual series, consists of seven reels of microfilm which documents meeting minutes from October and November 1970</p>
