            <a name="a2">Biographical Note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Reverend Monsignor Aloysius Kieran Ziegler was born on August 26, 1895 to a devout German Catholic family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ziegler received an extensive education that began with his studies at St. Francis Seminary, where he was ordained to the priesthood for the Milwaukee diocese and earned his Bachelor's Degree in 1919. After being ordained, Ziegler taught at the seminary and then earned his Master's Degree at the University of Wisconsin in 1925. Ziegler continued his studies at the Catholic University of America, where he earned his Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1927, Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1928, and Doctorate of Sacred Theology in 1930. He then spent four years conducting post-doctoral research in France at the Ecole Nationale des Chartes, earning a degree in Archiviste-Paleographe in 1934. That year he was appointed instructor in the both Greek and Latin and History Departments at CUA.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1938, Ziegler was promoted to Assistant Professor, then to Associate Professor in 1940, and finally to Ordinary Professor in 1960. He also served as the Head of the History Department from 1941-1961 and as the Associate editor for the Catholic Historical Review from 1936-1957. Ziegler retired from the CUA faculty in 1966 but remained Dean of the Catholic Sisters College until 1968. He also remained as a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Greek and Latin until 1977. Monsignor Ziegler was a renowned scholar in Medieval History as well as in Latin, and was known for his patient and prudent work in both his review and editorial work, and also as a director of dissertation research.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In addition to his academic work, Monsignor Ziegler was also deeply devoted to his priestly duties. This devotion was showcased by his work as Chaplain for Trinity College and as Chaplain and Moderator of the National Federation of Catholic College Students (NFCCS). For his committed work in these positions, Pope John XXIII elevated him to the rank of Domestic Prelate in 1959. In 1977, Monsignor Ziegler's health declined rapidly, prompting him to retire to St. Anne's Home for the Elderly in Milwaukee. He died on July 13, 1979 at the age of 83. Overall, Monsignor Ziegler will be remembered as a gifted scholar, administrator, and dedicated priest.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Aloysius Kieran Ziegler papers consist of ten boxes which make up seven series in total. The first series contains Ziegler's personal papers and correspondence, including letters to fellow religious, academics, and relatives. This series also includes Ziegler's personal financial records, and finally, prayer cards for deceased friends and family. The second series is comprised primarily of correspondence with students and administrators of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Catholic University.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The third series concerns largely History Department correspondence. Much of these materials are administrative, but include also correspondence with different historical societies and organizations that Ziegler belonged to or had a working relationship with through the department. The administrative correspondence consists of letters to the Rector's Office, the Dean of Arts and Sciences, and faculty members within the department.. The fourth series is a collection of Ziegler's best student papers and exams from undergraduate, Masters, and Doctoral students within the History department.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The fifth series of this collection concerns research that Ziegler had conducted through the years. Most of this research, which is handwritten on note cards or half sheets of paper, is on Medieval French Church manuscripts and Latin translation research on the Vulgate Bible. The Sixth series of this collection contains all correspondence and reports from Ziegler's time as Chaplain and Regional Moderator for the National Federation of Catholic College Students. The final series consists of publications that Ziegler had collected over the years. Many of these are newspaper clippings of developments within the American Catholic Church from 1920-1960s, but there are also booklets and pamphlets from the NCWC on education and American Civics, as well as book reviews of colleagues. Lastly, this series contains personal photos and postcards collected by Ziegler. Overall, the papers of Aloysius Kieran Ziegler cover a wide range of material from his personal papers to his work as a historian, Latin Scholar, and administrator.</p>
