            <a name="a2">Biography of Charles B. Broschart</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Charles B. Broschart was born August 12, 1898 in Dushore, Pennsylvania to parents George and Emma. He attended St. Basil's and Dushore High Schools. In 1921 he received a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from Pennsylvania State College. On June 12, 1929 he married Anna G. McGovern. They had two children together; Margret Ann, born in 1930, and George born in 1934. From 1921-1929 Broschart worked as an engineer for General Electric in New York and Pennsylvania; from 1925-1929 he worked as an instructor at Drexel University. In 1929 he began work at the Bradley Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, eventually being promoted to president in 1950.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">He is the author of 
                The Young Engineer (1953), 
                Marian Shrines That You Yourself Can Make (1954), and 
                Call Her Blessed (1961). Mr. Broschart passed away on January 3, 1989.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This collection contains the typed manuscript for the book, 
                Call Her Blessed, published by Society of St. Paul in 1961, and an additional 7 manuscripts of titles, legends, shrines, and sanctuaries of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
                Call Her Blessed and the additional unpublished stories in this collection were the result of twelve years of travel and research in which the author uncovered the origin and history of 1,000 titles held by the Blessed Virgin Mary, 78 of which are included in the published work. The stories are separated into eight 'books, organized by geographic location of the shrine, sanctuary, or monument to which the story relates. Some of the papers include an accompanying image, postcard, or photograph. Most of the stories are between 1-5 typewritten pages in length and include citations.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The collection also contains supplementary materials including translations of selections from L'Anno de Maria, a talk given on his research and writing process called 
                Madonnas of the World: A Discourse on the Legends and Shrines of the Blessed Virgin, slides used during the talk, film negatives, and photographs and images corresponding to the stories in the manuscripts.</p>
