            <a name="a2">History of the Marian Library</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Marian Library was founded by the Marianists of the University of Dayton in 1943 to make the Blessed Virgin Mary better known, loved, and served. It is a special library whose presence on campus is a significant expression of the university's Catholic and Marianist identity. Its collections are developed and maintained to preserve and provide access to materials that support its mission of fostering Marian scholarship and sound Marian devotion.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Marian Library is recognized both nationally and internationally as a center for scholarship on the Blessed Virgin Mary. It serves the research needs of faculty and students of the International Marian Research Institute and of the broader University of Dayton community, and of visitors throughout the world. It also documents the diverse expressions of popular devotion to Mary, and it provides public outreach through its exhibits, tours, and reference services.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">For more information on the Marian Library, please see the website of the International Marian Research Institute.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The 
                International Marian Shrines postcard collection was started by members of the Marian Library staff circa 1960.</p>
