In 1949 she married Joseph Edmund Cunneen in New York. In 1950, she and her husband co-founded the ecumenical quarterly, 
                Cross Currents, and she was associate editor until both retired in 1998. She was the mother of four sons, John, Michael, Peter, and Paul.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1964 Cunneen received her M.A. in English Literature with a major in Renaissance and minor in English Novel from Fordham University. She went on to receive an M.A. in Philosophy from Columbia University in 1977 and received her Ph.D. in Philosophy of Education from Teachers College Columbia University. She began teaching part-time at Rockland Community College (State University of New York) in 1970 and later became a full time Professor of English. Cuneen retired in 1993 and was awarded emerita status.</p>

                Sex: Female Religion: Catholic, 
                In Search of Mary: the Woman and the Symbol, 
                Mother Church: What the Experience of Women is Teaching Her,

                The Icon Reborn (with Frederick Franck). She was also the translator of Kurt Klinger's 
                A Pope Laughs: Stories of John XXIII. In addition to her books, she also authored a number of book reviews and articles. Cunneen was a frequent speaker and presenter at conferences, many on Catholic and Marian topics. She passed away in Nyack, New York on October 30, 2009.</p>
