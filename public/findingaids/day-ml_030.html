The collection includes meeting minutes, reports, planning documents, marketing materials, manuscripts, and correspondence documenting the history and activities of the periodical, primarily from 1955-1967 when it was published out of the Marian Library at the University of Dayton. Initially a means of communication for the Society of Mary (Marianists) about their spirit and apostolate, from 1955 on the Marianist became an all-Marian magazine. The magazine has been described as a "Marian digest" and included images, news, articles, and commentary on a wide range of topics related to the Virgin Mary.</a>

            <a name="a2">History of the Marianist magazine and Mary Today</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The periodical was founded in July 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, as the 
                Messenger of the Society of Mary, Province of America. The periodical was published by the Cincinnati Province of the Society of Mary and included articles on the Society of Mary, its works, and its members. Many of the articles were of a pedagogical nature. The periodical was published under this title until 1904 and was renamed the 
                Apostle of Mary: Echo of the Labors and Missions of the Society of Mary in January of 1905. Publication was suspended after June 1921 but revived in January 1927. Beginning with the January 1944 issue the magazine changed its name to the 
                Marianist. Editing responsibilities were transferred to Rev. William J. Ferree, S.M. The January 1944 issue included an explanation for the change in title as well as an editorial on the history of the publication.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">With the January 1955 issue (vol. 46, no. 1), Fr. Philip C. Hoelle, S.M., also the recently appointed Director of the Marian Library, assumed editing responsibilities for the 
                Marianist. Along with the transfer of responsibilities, the magazine became a publication of the Marian Library at the University of Dayton. Succeeding editors were Fr. John Mulligan, 1959-1962; Fr. Charles Lees, 1963-1965; and Fr. Adrian McCarthy, 1965-1967. Beginning with the January/February 1964 issue (vol. 55, no. 1), the magazine changed its title to 
                Mary Today. The magazine continued publication until 1967.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">During the twelve years in which the periodical was associated with the Marian Library, it was described as a "Marian digest," which included images, news, articles, and commentary. Regular features included a one-page article on a Marian feast of the current month, a page of news from the Marian Library, and reviews of Marian books. Theme issues, in which all the articles centered on a single topic, included three issues on Frank Duff's Legion of Mary, five special numbers on Mary's place in the ecumenical dialogue, and four devoted to Fr. Chaminade, founder of the Marianists, and the works he established. Individual articles were sometimes chosen for reprinting by 
                Catholic Mind, 
                Catholic Digest, and other publications. On two occasions the 
                Marianist received the award for general excellence in the class of devotional magazines from the Catholic Press Association.</p>
