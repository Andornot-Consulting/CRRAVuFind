            <a name="a2">History of the Marian Library</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Marian Library was founded by Marianists of the University of Dayton in 1943 to make the Blessed Virgin Mary better known, loved, and served. It is a special library whose presence on campus is a significant expression of the university's Catholic and Marianist identity. Its collections are developed and maintained to preserve and provide access to materials that support its mission of fostering Marian scholarship and sound Marian devotion.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Marian Library is recognized both nationally and internationally as a center for scholarship on the Blessed Virgin Mary. It serves the research needs of faculty and students of the International Marian Research Institute, the broader University of Dayton community, and of visitors throughout the world. It also documents the diverse expressions of Marian devotion, and it provides public outreach through exhibits, tours, and reference services.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">For more information on the Marian Library, please see the website of the International Marian Research Institute.</p>

          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This collection contains correspondence, personal accounts, articles, newsletters, photographs, audio recordings, artifacts, and ephemera documenting reported Marian apparitions in the United States and around the world. The collection primarily includes material related to apparitions in the 20th century from circa 1980 to circa 2000.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Although the collection contains some material dealing with the major, approved Marian apparitions (for example, Fátima and Lourdes), its focus is rather on documenting the hundreds of reported apparitions that are mostly unapproved. These include, for example, claims that are uninvestigated, under review, or which the bishop has made no decision regarding the supernatural character of the event.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Documents in the collection primarily include messages received by the visionaries or seers, news articles or publicity related to the apparition, and some newsletters or printed ephemera published by an organization promoting the apparition or a related Marian devotion.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Photographs in the collection include both original and reproduced images, most of which have been captured by amateur photographers. The photographs include, for example, images of clouds, plants and flowers, individuals, groups, statues, or artwork in which a miraculous image or event has been identified. The photographs are often accompanied by an interpretation or description of the miraculous image or event.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Audio recordings in the collection primarily include homilies, presentations, and interviews related to Marian apparitions.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Artifacts in the collection include items used in religious services related to an apparition (primarily from Lubbock, Texas), as well as items that were claimed to be part of a miraculous event including, for example, rose petals with Mary's image, glitter, feathers, and holy water.</p>
