          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This block would have been cut by an anonymous workman, after a design by a master imagier. Pear wood was often used in France, but the size of this block points to a larger tree, perhaps beechwood. The print would have been colored by hand or by stencil, probably by children, and sold to and used as objects of private devotion by pilgrims who visited the shrine of Notre-Dame-de-Bon Encontre, about six kilometers from Agen, a town in the Lot-et-Garonne, about 140 km southeast of Bordeaux. Although some sources date the origins of the cult to the early 14th century, the usually cited legend holds that in 1512 a young cowherd discovered a statue of the Virgin in some bushes next to the Garonne river. Repeated attempts to transfer the statue to the parish church failed, as it persisted in returning "home." A sanctuary was finally built on the riverside site. A manuscript register of miracles in the Departmental archives of the Lot-et-Garonne records 177 miracles said to have occurred there from 1583-1695. The largest wave of pilgrimages occurred in the 17th century, a period which witnessed a resurgence of Marian devotion in France. [excerpted from the Musinsky Rare Books catalog listing]</p>

          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This collection consists of an original woodblock for a devotional print of Notre Dame de Bon Encontre (1724), and an undated, modern print made from the woodblock, likely in the twenty-first century. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Single large woodblock (385 x 288 x 24 mm.), probably of beechwood, carved with a pilgrimage image of Notre Dame de Bon-Encontre, with title and date at top, four-line prayer at bottom (including heading), and imprint, in capitals, "Se vendent chez: [blank, apparently excised] Marchand Cartier a Agen, rue de --", the reverse side with two wide shallow grooves at top and bottom; loss to bottom corner affecting a letter of the prayer and street name at end of imprint, one or two small border losses, worming. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">A very rare survival: a woodblock for a devotional print. Black with soaked-in printer's ink, this intricately carved block is a reminder that the earliest European woodcuts were holy images. It shows a winged altarpiece. In the large central altar stands the holy statue of Notre Dame de Bon Encontre, holding the infant Christ, flanked by two angels and a pair of putti at top, between two double twisted columns wrapped with flowering braches. Each of the smaller altar wings has a scene from the life of the Virgin (Annunciation, and Mary with St. Anne) in the upper section, and scenes from the legend in the lower section. Surmounting the central altar is an arched compartment containing a small scene of Christ (apparently) with worshippers, with God the Father in a lunette at top. Two angels recline on slanting cornices. From the arched summit of the image hang hearts alternating with looped cords, and from the two recessed spaces above the arch hang the Emblems of the Passion, and three small placards, one with a cardinal's coat of arms, one with a symbol of a hand holding a candle, and the third with a pierced heart (printer's?) device and the date, 1724.
