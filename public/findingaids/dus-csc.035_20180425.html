          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Conference of Major Superiors of Men is an association of the leaders of male religious orders and apostolic institutes in the United States.  The organization of the Conference came about in 1956 when Pope Pius XII called for national associations of religious organizations around the world to be established.  The main objectives of the conference are: to provide support to leaders of religious groups and orders to be effective leaders; to engage in dialogue and collaborate with leaders both in the Church and in society at large; and, to provide a voice and influence for male religious leaders through the national and regional structures of the conference.
