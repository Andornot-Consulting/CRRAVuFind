            <a name="a2">History of the Catholic Labor Institute</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Reverend Thomas F. Coogan founded the 
                Catholic Labor Institute (CLI) on 13 February 1947; 
                Reverend Joseph V. Kearney was it spiritual director. Membership was for "practical Catholics" and for members of labor unions, per the CLI's constitution. That Los Angeles Archbishop 
                John Cantwell blessed the organization spoke to its roots in the Roman Catholic Church. The purpose of the CLI was to  support workers and labor unions in Southern California through such means as newsletters, programs and classes, discussion groups, counseling, and a speakers bureau.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The group's purpose was fulfilled in different ways. Coogan headed—before his untimely death 26 October 1947—the Leo XIII School of Social Action. Other CLI outreaches included the Pius XI School of Labor Relations, at St. Mary's in Boyle Heights that Reverend 
                Thomas O'Dwyer directed. In 1947, Coogan set the tone for the Catholic Labor Institute at its first Labor Day mass at St. Vibiana's Cathedral (which became an annual event presided over by the archbishop of Los Angeles, along with a breakfast) when he criticized the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, which had curtailed the Wagner Act. The union leaders in the pews were undoubtedly pleased at this denunciation.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The CLI also took an active stance against Communism, opposing the communist-dominated United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE) Local 142 in its drive to lead Standard Coil in Los Angeles.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Catholic Labor Institute was especially active in the Mexican-American community of Los Angeles, including the 
                International Ladies Garment Workers' Union (See the blog post of Kenneth Burt "Catholic Labor Institute in Los Angeles", http://http://kennethburt.com/blog/?p=729; accessed 13 September 2012). To this end, it offered citizenship classes in support of its Mexican American constitutents.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The last director of the CLI was 
                Patrick W. Henning. The organization ended sometime in the early 1990s.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The 
                Catholic Labor Institute Collection documents the history of the Catholic Labor Institute (CLI) through photographs, correspondence, newspaper clippings, flyers, pamphlets, and personal notes (most likely those of the last director of the CLI, Patrick W. Henning). The materials principally cover the first five years of the CLI's existence (1947-1952), and the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Patrick W. Henning was its director--and its last.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Of special interest in this collection are the materials documenting the break between the Archdiocese of Los Angeles under 
                Cardinal Roger Mahony and the Catholic Labor Institute over the unionization of the archdiocese's cemetery workers (see Series 1, Box 1, Folders 4 and 5). Also noteworthy are the materials on the classes and programs that the CLI sponsored to educate and train workers in union organizing (see Series 1, Box 1, Folder 1; and Series 3, Box 2ov).</p>

                        Reverend Thomas F. Coogan and Reverend Joseph V. Kearney in the 1940s and 1950s, which Henning probably preserved. For example, the materials in folder 1 came from a file folder labelled in pencil "Institute History," which Henning may have kept for his own reference or to preserve the history of the CLI or both.</p>
          <p>Materials in this series include newspaper clippings on labor issues in Los Angeles and California or the CLI, pamphlets for training programs and classes of the CLI, press releases, correpsondence, the newsletter of the CLI ("The Mediator"), speeches, and photographs.</p>
