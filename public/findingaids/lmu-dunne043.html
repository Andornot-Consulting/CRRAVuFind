            <a name="a2">Biography</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Father George H. Dunne, S.J., (1906-1998) was a pioneer Catholic voice for civil rights in the United States, a voice ably expressed in numerous essays on the topic. Dunne earned his masters from Gonzaga University in 1932 and spent several years in the mid-1930s in China as a Jesuit missionary. He returned to the United States and earned a doctorate in international relations in 1944 from the University of Chicago. His first academic position was at the University of St. Louis, but his criticism of the policies of racial segregation at the university resulted in his dismissal. He was transferred to Loyola University (Los Angeles), where he was dismissed again, in this case because of his support of a strike of the stage employees union. Father Dunne eventually served at Georgetown University and became the director of the university’s program at Fribourg, Switzerland, until he retired in 1985, after which he lived at the Jesuit community at Loyola Marymount University. Dunne’s article “The Sin of Segregation” was published in the journal Commonweal in 1945 and represented his opening salvo against racial prejudice. The essay made him among the first Catholic clerics to label prejudice a sin and was only the first of many essays condemning racism. Dunne also wrote a play (“Trial by Fire”) on the bombing of an African-American family who had just moved to an all-white neighborhood. His best scholarly work was his study of Jesuits in China, Generation of Giants (1962). Dunne’s autobiography, King's Pawn: The Memoirs of George H. Dunne, S.J., was published in 1990.</p>

            <a name="a3">Collection Description</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The George H. Dunne, S.J., Collection of Articles and Pamphlets consists of works by and about this well-known Jesuit. The collection contains the most important works of Dunne, eg, his seminal article on racism, “The Sin of Segregation” (1945). Chronologically his works in this collection run from 1945 through 1989, including a manuscript of his biography “King’s Pawn,” thus giving this collection in-depth witness to Dunne’s thought. Some materials are only photocopies. There are also two letters and a smattering of photographs. The collection came to the library of Loyola Marymount University in 1998, the year of Dunne’s death at the Jesuit retirement community at Los Gatos, making it probable that Dunne collected the materials before his death, after which the Jesuit Community turned them over to the library.</p>
