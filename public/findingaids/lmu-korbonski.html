          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Dr. Andrzej Korbonski (1927-2013) was a long-time political science professor at UCLA, whose research interests in Communist Poland and Eastern Europe stemmed from his Polish birth. Korbonski served in the Polish Free Army in Great Britain during World War II, and after the war ended, he immigrated to the United States. He earned a doctorate in political science from Columbia in 1962, upon which he gained a position in the Department of Political Science at UCLA in 1963. He retired from UCLA in 1994, although remaining active as an emeritus professor.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Dr. Korbonski published numerous books and articles on Communist Poland, a research pursuit that is reflected in the materials in this collection.</p>

            <a name="a3">Collection Description</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Containing materials (all textual) in both Polish and English, this small collection (1.25 linear feet) consists principally of publications of the research arm of Radio Free Europe and photocopies of original documents from a major Polish state archive and from the United States Department of State (these are declassified). Dr. Andrzej Korbonski collected these sources for his research on Communist Poland.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Radio Free Europe materials are in Series 1 and Series 2. These include reports on social, political, and economic conditions in Poland; noteworthy are the reports on the Polish Roman Catholic Church and John Paul II, and the rise of Solidarity under Lech Walesa. These reports are in English, although there are a number of press summaries in Polish in Series 2 that "East (sic) Europe Research" of Radio Free Europe gathered.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Of special interest is Series 3 with its photocopies of documents from the Archiwum Akt Nowych, a major Polish governmental repository. Samples of these documents include an information bulletin from the Ministry of Internal Affairs concerning meetings of Polish Roman Catholic bishops. Another concerns a statement from the Archbishop of Krakow, Karol Wojtyla (John Paul II), to a member of the Polish Parliament concerning a religious procession. The materials are all in Polish in this series. Dr. Nibel Raab, of LMU's Department of History, graciously helped in the translation of some of the documents, which provided insight into the information that they contain.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Series 5 consists of photocopies of memoranda and telegrams sent either to President Franklin D. Roosevelt or to the Secretary of State from the Department of State, and messages from the Secretary of State to F.D.R. The memoranda and telegrams concern U.S. views of, and meetings with, the Polish government in exile in the last years of World War II. The materials also cover the U.S. government's relations with Polish Premier Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, U.S. financing of the Polish underground, the American Polish Congress, Polish-Soviet Union relations, the Warsaw Uprising, and U.S. and Soviet views on the post-war form of Polish government and society.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Most of the original material in Series 5 was classified until the 1970s. Names of note in this series include diplomat 
                Averell Harriman (1891-1986) and U.S. Secretary of State 
                Cordell Hull (1871-1955).</p>
