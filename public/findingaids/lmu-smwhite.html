          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The son of an Irish immigrant, Stephen Mallory White was born in San Francisco in 1853, received his law degree from Santa Clara College in 1871. In 1874 he moved to Los Angeles, where he practiced law and founded the Los Angeles Bar Association in 1878.  He also became involved in Democratic party politics.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">White married Hortense Sacriste in 1883 and, that same year, started a one-year term as District Attorney. Three years later, White became a state senator representing the district in and around Los Angeles. In 1893, as a Free-Silver Democrat,  White won a seat in the United States Senate--the first native Californian to represent the state--and saw his term through to 1899. He became well known for his opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad's plan to have Santa Monica designated as Los Angeles' harbor.  Instead, White stood up to Collis P. Huntington and his Southern Pacific Railroad by helping steer a huge federal subsidy to the building of a harbor at San Pedro. White died in 1902, at the age of 48.</p>

          <p>This series consists of letters that Stephen Mallory White wrote to his wife Hortense Sacriste White. Most of the letters are addressed to "Fat Baby," "F.B." or "F." There are a few letters from White to his children. White wrote the letters when Hortense White was away from home (1884, 1885, 1889, and 1891); when he was away from home working on legal cases (1886, 1890, 1895 and 1900); when he was campaigning for Senate in Northern California (1892-1893); and when he was serving as a United States Senator (1893, 1894, 1896, 1897, 1898). Most of the letters are filled with questions about and reports of family members and their health. White also writes about the difficult weather conditions during his summers in Washington, D.C. White did not write many details about his work as an attorney or a senator. He did briefly mention some of the cases and legislation with which he was involved.

          <p>Series 8 consists of three dimensional materials. There are many badges, some for political conventions (including Democratic National Conventions) and others for societies, such as the Native Sons of the Golden West. A leather portfolio ("Stephen M. White, U.S. Senate") and two medals (Inauguration March 1897; Joint Committee Senate) represent White's time as a U.S. Senator. There is also a box of White's personal calling cards, some religious medals, and a large trunk.</p>
