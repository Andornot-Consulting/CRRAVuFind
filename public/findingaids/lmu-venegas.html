          <h3>
            <a name="a2">Biography / Administrative History</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">This collection documents principally the lives of Miguel and Dolores ("Lola") Venegas, both originally residents of Zapotlanejo, of the  state of Jalisco, Mexico, before immigrating to Los Angeles in 1927. Miguel was born to Juan Venegas and Julia Cárdenas de Venegas  in 1897; Dolores to Silviano Dávalos and Dolores Morales de Dávalos in 1900.  Miguel was the eldest of eight children,  Dolores the second of four.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Miguel's original home was a ranch (Rancho San Roque, Jalsico, Mexico), owned by Miguel’s grandfather, Donaciano Venegas.  The family  eventually moved to Zapotlanejo.  Here Juan Venegas opened a bakery—later expanded to a grocery store—where Miguel would eventually work,  after first working on the "Hacienda de Colimilla" (by 1914). Following this work for his father in Zapotlanejo, he then managed a general  store there. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The family of Dolores Dávalos was prosperous, its financial wellbeing resting on the five haciendas (large landed estates) that  her maternal grandfather José María Morales had accumulated. Dolores attended school through the third grade; her future  husband, Miguel, made it through the fourth—and final—grade, although he pursued extensive reading on his own after his primary education  ended. In 1918, the two became engaged; their marriage followed one year later (1919). </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Four sons were born in the first seven years of the marriage: José Miguel (1920-); Ricardo (1922-); Guillermo (1924-), and  Eduardo (1926-1999). Through ownership of a profitable general store and the inheritance of a ranch (El Ingenio) from  Dolores' grandparents, and acquisition of another (El Cerro), the couple prospered. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Cristero Rebellion (1926-1929), the revolt of Mexican Roman Catholics against the relentlessly anti-clerical policies of the  government of president Plutarco Elías Calles, upended the lives of Dolores and Miguel Venegas, devout Roman Catholics. Miguel and  brother Alfonso joined the Cristero forces, taking to the countryside with the Cristero armed forces. Alfonso would die in the service of  the Cristeros, but Miguel survived, although the suppression of the Cristeros, and their persecution in his home town of Zapotlanejo, would  force his and his family's move to the United States for safety.  He chose Los Angeles, partly because of the many Cristero refugees from  Jalisco there, and arrived in June 1927.  His family would join him later that year, in October. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The family settled in the Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles, where in the first three years in Los Angeles, Dolores bore two more  children:  Juan José (1928-1997) and María Teresa (1930-). In addition, four more children would be born to Dolores and  Miguel:  Alfonso (1933-1966); José María (1935-); Enrique (1939-); and Carlos (1941-). </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">To support himself and his family, Miguel first worked as a dishwasher, but using money that Dolores had made from the sale of their  cattle in Zapotlanejo, he bought a small store at 805 California Street (the corner of Bunker Hill and California) that came with a house  at 419 North Bunker Hill Street and attached garages that were rented out. The store, although hard and time-consuming work for both  Dolores and Miguel (it was normally open six and one half days per week), provided for a comfortable living: Miguel could afford to buy a  car, for example. Because of his forced move from Zapotlanejo, problems with creditors there over his business and lands still plagued  Miguel and proved a consistent concern. The Depression would bring severe financial hardship to the family because business at the store  suffered from the inability of clients to pay—a persistent problem throughout the 1930s.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Miguel returned to Mexico in 1932 for a ten day visit, to determine if conditions in Zapotlanejo were favorable for his family's return,  which, he decided, were not. Consequently, he returned to Los Angeles that same year, but eight years later Miguel decided to return with  his family to Mexico, while retaining his business in Los Angeles, which his sons José Miguel, Ricardo, and Guillermo managed for  him.  Miguel gave up his rented home at 808 California Street, to which the family had moved after leaving the smaller residence at 419  North Bunker Hill Street. The garages that were part of the store at 805 California were converted to living quarters for the three sons. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Miguel Venegas returned to Los Angeles in December 1941, and the entire family returned in 1942. The converted rooms at the store at 805  California Street provided the initial living quarters, but in 1946, the family moved to 1505 West Temple Street, where Miguel and Dolores  would reside until their deaths. That same year Miguel relocated his store to the corner of Grand and Temple streets, which he ran until  the late 1940s, when the City of Los Angeles bought the property in that area for the construction of the county and city court buildings.  </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The family maintained close contacts with relatives in Guadalajara and Zapotlanejo.  The trip of José Miguel to Mexico to attend  the 1938 meeting of the Asociación Católica de la Juventud Mexicana resulted in a lengthy stay in Guadalajara and  Zapotlanejo, which foreshadowed extended family vacations to Mexico to visit family and friends beginning in the mid 1940s. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In the 1940s, Miguel expanded his Los Angeles business ventures by moving into the management and ownership of real estate.  This first  occurred, circa 1942, when Japanese neighbors asked him to manage their apartment complex (the Elite Apartments) in the Bunker Hill area  because of their forced move to internment camps. In either 1943 or 1944 Miguel Venegas bought a Victorian home remodeled into apartments  on Flower Street. He continued to acquire and manage property at least until the early 1960s, when it is known that he developed apartments on Court Street in Los Angeles in 1962. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In World War II, three sons would serve in the armed forces: José Miguel, Ricardo, and Guillermo. Miguel served in the United  States Army Air Corps in Europe, flying thirty-three missions as a radio operator on a B-17. Ricardo was a member of the United States  Army, serving in Alaska, while Guillermo saw combat in the South Pacific with the United States Army. In the Korean War, Juan José  Venegas would earn a Purple Heart. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The family, of course, was active in the Roman Catholic Church, attending mass, at least in the early years in Los Angeles, at "La  Placita" (La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Angeles or Our Lady Queen of Angels), the Roman Catholic church on the plaza  of old Los Angeles and a center for Mexican-American cultural life. Miguel Venegas became active in the Knights of Columbus, eventually  reaching the fourth degree. Dolores Venegas' stature in the Mexican-American community was confirmed when she received the honor of  "Mexican Mother of the Year" in 1969, the same year that she and Miguel celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary with their extended family. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1973, Miguel and Dolores began splitting the year between Zapotlanejo and Los Angeles, after building a residence in the former. In  Mexico, Miguel devoted his time to charity, funding the construction of a Red Cross hospital in Zapotlanejo and a school in nearby  Jocotopec. In recognition of this, a street in Zapotlanejo is named after him. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Dolores Venegas passed away in 1991. Miguel Venegas died in 1994, but not before becoming a citizen of the United States in 1992. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">All information in this biography comes from the Venegas Family Papers, Collection 099; or else from Venegas family members, principally  Carlos Venegas and Dr. María Teresa Venegas, especially her family history (for which, see Series 1, Subseries A, Box 1, Folder 7).  </p>

          <h3>
            <a name="a3">Scope and Content of Collection</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Venegas Family Papers document extensively the history of this family, headed by Dolores, "Lola" (1900-1991) and Miguel Venegas (1989-1994), in Los Angeles, and in Zapotlanejo and Guadalajara, of the state of Jalisco, Mexico, through textual and photographic materials, DVDs, and Roman Catholic realia. The dates of  the material run from 1899 to 2003.   Textual materials include newspaper clippings, government birth and immigration records, and  anniversary and funeral registers and guest books. Most revealing of the textual materials for the family history and its broader  significance is the extensive correspondence, especially that between Miguel and Dolores Venegas and relatives in Guadalajara and Zapotlanejo,  in Jalisco, Mexico.  The correspondence ranges from the late 1920s through the early 1990s, documenting well Venegas family affairs in both Los Angeles and in Mexico, since Miguel and Dolores and their children maintained extensive contacts with their homeland. Almost all the correspondence is in Spanish, and often colloquial, with irregular orthography, which in itself is noteworthy  evidence for Spanish linguistics and levels of literacy in Mexico. Of special interest is the use  of the word "chicano"; for example, Miguel Venegas call his children that in a letter of  (Series 1, Subseries A, Box 1, Folder 2; 30 October 1928 ). Such usages may stand as some of the earliest written instances of this word in the United States.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Especially valuable is the correspondence found in Series 1, Subseries A and Subseries D, which Dr. María Teresa Venegas (1930-),  daughter of Dolores and Miguel Venegas, specifically arranged to document family history during its first five years in Los Angeles after  moving here to avoid persecution during the Cristero Rebellion. Subseries A consists of a series of letters from Miguel, and occasionally  Dolores, sent to Miguel's father and brother Francisco in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. In these letters  from 1927 through 1932, Miguel  and Dolores describe life for a Mexican immigrant family in Los Angeles, including conditions of work for the Mexican immigrant community,  political freedoms in Los Angeles versus those in Mexico, the effects of the Depression, means of success for a Mexican immigrant in Los  Angeles, and secular versus Roman Catholic education for their children in Los Angeles. In addition,  Miguel Venegas also writes of the  Cristero Rebellion, including, for example, his thoughts on persecution of Roman Catholics in Jalisco (Box  1, Folder 2) or the agreement between the government of President Emilio Portes Gil and the Mexican church, headed by Archbishop Leopoldo  Ruiz y Flores, to end the rebellion. Responses to these letters from relatives in Guadalajara and Zapotlanejo are found in Subseries  D, with notes from Dr. Venegas correlating these letters with those found in Subseries A.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">  
Also valuable witness to Mexican immigrant life in Los Angeles are the letters that José Miguel Venegas (1920-), eldest child of  Miguel and Dolores Venegas, wrote to relatives in Guadalajara and Zapotlanejo, Mexico, and also which he, while in Mexico, wrote to his  family in Los Angeles (series 1, Subseries E). Miguel Venegas' letters cover aspects of daily life, including his work to support the family, fluency in English, the  well-being of his father's store, Christmas gifts, and, at the request of his uncle Francisco Venegas, an outline of his daily routine.  Rich in family sentiment, Miguel's letters also stand as a good source of social history for a Mexican family in Los Angeles.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Other textual materials (Series 2) concern records of the family's immigration, such as the head tax documents of Miguel and Dolores;  newspaper clippings, especially concerning Dolores Venegas' award as Mexican Mother of the Year (1969); and a smattering of Miguel Venegas' business records. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">

The photographs of this collection are also rich for the social life of a Mexican family in Los Angeles. They consist of loose photographs  (Series 3) and albums (Series 6). Loose photographs include elegant family group pictures or single portraits, from circa 1900 through the 1960s, of  extended Venegas family members in both Mexico and the United States. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
Albums document photographically Venegas family life in Los Angeles, including trips to the beach, the family store, school, and family  milestones, such as the fiftieth wedding anniversary of Miguel and Dolores Venegas.  Furthermore, their home of Zapotlanejo and Guadalajara  are not neglected with photographic postcards and photographs dating from the 1930s. Also interesting is a photograph of the funeral in  1936 of Bishop José Francisco Orozco y Jiménez, supporter of Roman Catholic religious rights during the Cristero Rebellion.  Whether loose photographs or in albums these photographs, especially those from 1900 to 1950, stand as cultural markers of dress, social  status, religious life, and family relations. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
The collection is also strong in religious realia associated with Roman Catholic religious practices.  A devout Roman Catholic family, the  Venegas family owned numerous holy cards, "spiritual bouquets," scalpulars, and religious images, which all document religious piety through  their themes and emphases. The realia are found in Series 2 and Series 5.  Those clearly associated with a Venegas family member, eg,  Dolores Venegas' collection of holy cards, rosaries, crosses, etc. (Box 3ov), were placed with the personal papers and possession of the  Venegases, while those loose religious realia were placed in Series 5 designed to accommodate such items. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">
The first cousin once removed of Miguel Venegas was María de Jesús Sacramentado Venegas ("Madre Nati"); she was also the  first female Mexican saint. In Series 6, there is a run of materials related to her beatification (1992) and canonization (2000) collected  principally by María Teresa Venegas during family trips to Rome for these occasions.  These include photographs of the ceremonies,  programs, biographical and religious booklets and pamphlets on the saint.  There is also a DVD of the beatification ceremony in Rome for  the Mexican martyrs of the Cristero Rebellion.

          <p>Dr. María Teresa Venegas,  daughter of Dolores ("Lola") and Miguel Venegas, specifically arranged this family correspondence to document her family's history during its first five years in Los Angeles after  the family’s move here in 1927 to avoid persecution during the Cristero Rebellion in their home state of Jalisco, in Mexico. Subseries A consists of a series of letters from Miguel, and occasionally Dolores, sent to Miguel's father Juan and brother Francisco in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. In these letters from 1927 through 1932, Miguel and Dolores describe life for a Mexican immigrant family in Los Angeles, including the economic challenges and opportunities for the Mexican immigrant community,  political freedoms in Los Angeles versus those in Mexico, the effects of the Depression, avenues of success for a Mexican immigrant in Los  Angeles, and secular versus Roman Catholic education for their children in Los Angeles. </p>
          <p>In addition,  Miguel Venegas also writes of the  Cristero Rebellion, including, for example, his thoughts on religious persecution in Jalisco (Box  1, Folder 2) or the agreement between the government of President Emilio Portes Gil and the Mexican church, headed by Archbishop Leopoldo  Ruiz y Flores, to end the rebellion. Responses to these letters from relatives in Guadalajara and Zapotlanejo are found in Subseries  D, with notes from Dr. Venegas correlating these letters with those found in Subseries A. Unless otherwise noted, all letters are by Miguel Venegas. Copies made from PDFs of the originals have been substituted for the originals because of their fragility.</p>
          <p>Dr. Venegas used these letters to write a family history of her parents, entitled "Letters Home"  (Box 1, Folder 7, Series 1, Subseries A). This rough draft contains translations of the letters as well as biographies of her parents. </p>

          </h3>
          <p>Series 1, Subseries B, consists of incoming and outgoing correspondence from Venegas family members to Miguel (1897-

1994) and Dolores Venegas (1900-1991). This correspondence in general was loose or in bundles,  most likely arranged that way either 

by Dolores or Miguel Venegas.  In contrast, for example, Dr. María Teresa Venegas, daughter of Miguel and Dolores, gathered and organized the correspondence now found

in Subseries A of this series (" Miguel Venegas and Dolores Venegas Correspondence, 1927-1932") specifically for her family history.</p>
          <p>Almost all the correspondence is in Spanish and is arranged in chronological order. There are strong runs of incoming correspondence from Juan (d. 

1955; father of Miguel) and Francisco Venegas (brother of Miguel; dates unknown) from the 1930s through the 1950s. This principally concern 

family business concerns in Guadalajara and Zapotlanejo, Jalisco, Mexico, such as development and rental of a ranch/farm and exchanges of 

money, as well as other matters such as family health.  Dolores ("Lola") Venegas received numerous letters from her sister Ana María 

Dávalos de Martínez and sister-in-law Mercedes Gutierrez de Dávalos, which touch on family concerns and issues of 

importance in Guadalajara, eg, killings at a protest in Guadalajara against socialist education (Box 2, Folder 2; 3 March 1935). There are 

incoming letters from Venegas children to their parents, Dolores and Miguel, when the former were staying with relatives in Guadalajara and 

Zapotlanejo.  One letter, from father Silviano Dávalos (dates unknown) to daughter Dolores, touches on the "reconcentración," the 

forced relocation of residents of Jalisco by the Mexican government during the Cristero Rebellion (Box 2, Folder 1; January 1928).
</p>
          <p>
 For Miguel Venegas, Box 4, Folder 4, contains files with his business and personal correspondence. There are also numerous cards for the 

christenings, graduations, and weddings of friends and family members of Miguel and Dolores Venegas (Box 3, passim). In general, this 

subseries, as is true of most of the Venegas family correspondence, contains rich information on the social, religious, and economic lives 

of the Mexican community in Los Angeles and in Jalisco.</p>

				1923-1948 8 folders </font>
          </h3>
          <p>Subseries C contains the letters (in Spanish) of Sor Gabriela de la Inmaculada Concepción (Soledad Venegas, "Chole"; dates unknown) and Sor Amada del Niño Jesús (María del Rosario Venegas, "Chayo"; d. 2012), sisters of Miguel Venegas. Copies of the originals are employed for research use because of the fragility of the originals, except for Box 4, Folder 12, which contains original photocopies. </p>
          <p>The majority of the letters were to their parents Juan and Julia Venegas, and treat the trip of the two sisters to, and then their state of life in, the convent of the Monastery of Perpetual Adoration in San Francisco, California, where their order (Sisters of Perpetual Adoration) took up residence because of the Cristero Rebellion. This subseries also holds two letters of Sor Amada as María del Rosario Venegas before she took religious vows (Box 4, Folder 7); one treats her trip to the convent in San Francisco, where she took up the religious life.  The letters provide striking examples of the religious sentiments of these two Mexican religious before and after the assumption of the religious state.</p>
          <p>Also present in this subseries are original photocopies of letters from their brother Francisco (dates unknown) to Miguel Venegas (1897-1994), which concern family matters and business. These  photocopies are difficult to read. One letter is from female religious to Juan Venegas.</p>
          <p>All correspondence in this subseries, except for the photocopies in folder 12, is arranged by year, and come from a notebook entitled "Letters from Aunts and Bros. 1927-1948." Based on the style of handwriting, the niece of these two religious (Dr. María  Teresa Venegas) probably assembled the notebook.  The dates found on the title of the notebook do not correspond to those of the letters themselves.</p>

          <p>
This subseries consists of letters that Juan Venegas (d. 1955), father of Miguel, and Francisco (dates unknown), brother of Miguel, wrote to Miguel and Dolores Venegas. There is one letter from Francisco to his sister, Sor Gabriela de la Inmaculada Concepción (Soledad Venegas, "Chole"; dates unknown).</p>
          <p>Dr. María Teresa Venegas, daughter of Miguel and Dolores, grouped these letters together, since they are responses to the letters of Miguel in Series 1, Subseries A.  The notes of Dr. Venegas indicating the letters to which they are a response have been retained in the copies of the letters, which were substituted for the originals because of their fragility. These letters are all in Spanish and arranged chronologically by year. The correspondence concerns family business and personal concerns, and religious and health practices. Most are carbon copies of the originals; persons writing letters in such places as Guadalajara had professionals type them on carbon, with the carbons preserved as records of the originals. For research purposes, copies of these carbon copies are used, because of their fragility.

          </h3>
          <p>Born in Zapotlanejo, Jalisco, Mexico in 1920, José Miguel Venegas was the first child of Miguel and Dolores Venegas. With his family he immigrated to Los Angeles, California, in 1927, where he attended Roman Catholic schools. From 1940 to 1942 he helped run the family store, when most of his family had returned to Mexico. In 1942, he married María Alicia Martínez, with whom he had eight children. That same year he entered the United States Army, and during World War II  served in the United States Army Air Corps, reaching the rank of staff sergeant and serving as the chief radio operator on a B-17 of the 94th Bombardment Group, 410th Squadron.  His distinguished military career saw him fly on thirty-three missions over Europe, including missions over Normandy on D-Day.</p>
          <p>After his discharge from the service in September 1945, José Miguel Venegas  returned to Los Angeles, and helped his in-laws run their grocery store at the corner of Pico and Union Streets.  In 1965, he opened Omega Precision, a machine tool company in Santa Fe Springs, California, which grew in size over the years to become a sixteen thousand feet facility.  José  Miguel Venegas resides in Chino Hills, California. </p>
          <p>This subseries consists of a run of letters, all in Spanish, that José Miguel Venegas had kept from his youth, and then donated them to Loyola Marymount University through his brother Carlos and sister, Dr. María Teresa Venegas. (Series 1, Subseries B, contains his other correspondence, which he had not maintained.) José Miguel wrote the letters in this subseries as a youth, from 1928 to 1931, and in 1935 and 1938. Venegas wrote the former group of letters  from Los Angeles to relatives in Mexico, principally to his Uncle Francisco (Pancho), the brother of  José Miguel's father, Miguel. The correspondence provides insights into the life of a Mexican immigrant youth in Los Angeles, touching on such matters as fluency in English, his daily routine, family finances, and work. The letter from 1935 provides the lyrics of "La Cucaracha," which Venegas learned while picking fruit in northern California. The letters, all outgoing, are arranged chronologically by year. Copies made from PDFs have been substituted for the original copies because of their fragility. Translations of the letters by Dr. María Teresa Venegas are found in Box 1, Folder 7, of Series 1, Subseries A.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>This series contains photographs of at least three generations of the family of Miguel and Dolores Venegas. The earliest dates from 1899 and is that of the grandmother of Dolores Venegas:  Ignacia González de Morales (dates unknown). There are also polaroid color photographs from the early 1990s of picnics of extended Venegas family outings, which probably include shots of the fourth generation of the family. As just indicated the type of photographs in the series varies, from card photographs of different sizes, to polaroids, photographic postcards and even duplication of originals. </p>
          <p>Noteworthy are the loose photographs of Venegas family outings to Lincoln Park and the beach in the late 1920s (Box 10, Folder 15), which provide photographic documentation of Mexican immigrant life in Los Angeles at that time. Also of value is the run of photographs of the "boda de oro" (golden wedding anniversary) of the parents of Miguel Venegas, Juan Venegas (d. 1955) and  Julia Cárdenas de Venegas (d. 1961) in either 1946 or 1947 (Box 4ov).  These photographs richly document aspects of domestic and religious life in Guadalajara.</p>
          <p>The majority of photographs are in black and white; if not noted as color in the contents field of the box and folder list, then a photograph is in black and white. Some photographs bear notations with information about the persons in the photograph, often provided by Dr. María Teresa Venegas, daughter of Dolores and Miguel Venegas, while others came with stick-it notes that provided information. The latter have been photocopied on acid-free paper and stored with the original photograph.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>This series contains materials that Dr. María Teresa Venegas collected concerning the beatification (1992) and canonization (2000) of  María de Jesús Sacramentado Venegas (Natividad Venegas de la Torre; 1868-1959), the first cousin once removed of Miguel Venegas, the father of Dr. Venegas. The canonization of María de Jesús Sacramentado Venegas was of great significance, for this member of the Venegas family, known as "Madre Nati," was the first female Mexican saint, one noted for her devotion and service to the poor and sick in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, as superior general of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  A sign of her vigorous faith, she was an active religious during the troubles of the Cristero Rebellion of the 1920s that saw persecution of practicing Roman Catholics.</p>
          <p> Materials in this series include holy cards; biographical, liturgical, and inspirational booklets and pamphlets; order of ceremony and tickets to the canonization; newspaper articles; and photographs of the saint and also Venegas family members during their trips to Rome for their relative's ceremonies of beatification and canonization. There is also a DVD of her beatification ceremony in 1992. Of special interest is the relic of this saint found in folder 13 of Box 11.</p>

          <p>Thirteen albums make up this series, including loose leaves from an album (Box 19, Folder 1). The albums include those that Dolores Venegas probably assembled of her family, eg, that in Boxes 15 and 16; and  those that Dr. María Teresa Venegas, daughter of Dolores and Miguel Venegas, assembled (in this regard, see especially Box 14, which contains the album specifically prepared to document her parent's history). Photographs or other items such as newspaper articles were separated from albums with damaging leaves of acidic or sticky paper. The original leaves were photocopied and numbered in order, with the designation "verso" or "recto" for each photocopy. The original photographs are stored in acid-free sleeves that accompany the photocopies of the original leaf. All photographs are in black and white, unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>As with all of this collection the albums document extensively Mexican-American life in Los Angeles and life in Jalisco, Mexico. The former, in albums in Boxes 14, 15, and 16, yields photographs of the Venegas family at work and play and at school. This includes such charity work as the Red Cross hospital in Zapotlanejo that Miguel Venegas funded (Box 17, Folder 5) or else Venegas family excursions (Box 17,Folders 1-2). The album in Box 18 contains such historically important photographs as that of the funeral procession in 1936 in Guadalajara of Bishop José Francisco Orozco, a staunch leader of Roman Catholics in Jalisco during their troubles with the Mexican government. Box 14 constitutes the album that Dr. María Teresa Venegas assembled to accompany her family history (Series 1, Subseries A, Box 1, Folder 7).</p>
