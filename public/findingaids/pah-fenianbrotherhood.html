                <a name="ref1">The Fenian Brotherhood, the American branch of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, was established in 1858 with the goal of establishing an independent Ireland. As well as raising money and gathering arms to send back to Ireland, the Fenians also engaged in military activity against the British, leading two failed invasions of Canada. Factionalism within the organization led to the Brotherhood's decline by the 1880s. This collection primarily contains the correspondence of Francis B. Gallagher, a Fenian Senator and district treasurer from Buffalo, NY with other senior Fenian officials. Also included are some administrative records, including circular letters, finance reports, and meeting minutes. The papers document the Brotherhood's activities, including its failed invasion of Canada, as well as the internal divisions that led to the organization's demise.</a>

          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">With the support of Irish Americans, James Stephens, leader of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood (I.R.B.), established the Brotherhood’s American division, the Fenian Brotherhood, in the fall of 1858. With local branches active in cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, and New York, the organization grew to over 50,000 members and hundreds of thousands of sympathizers by the end of the Civil War.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Although Stephens had intended that the Fenians would primarily focus on fundraising and supplying arms to help the I.R.B. attain its goal of an independent Ireland, the organization became much more active and aggressive. Functioning as a secret society for the first several years, the Fenians decided to make their cause public, using publications and advertisements to garner support. Also, a strong contingent of its members wanted the Brotherhood to engage in military activities. Rather than merely sending supplies and soldiers to Ireland, they supported the idea of attacking the British by invading Canada. The Fenians made several failed attempts in 1866 and 1870.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">British resistance, internal factionalism, and the organization's failed military efforts led to the Fenian Brotherhood’s collapse in 1886. By this time, a significant portion of the organization had already been absorbed by the Irish nationalist organization Clan-na-Gael.</p>

            <a name="a3">Scope and Contents note</a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">During the 3rd Fenian Convention in Philadelphia in October 1865, members established a fifteen-member senate, which assumed most of the authority previously held by the Brotherhood’s President. The papers in this collection, mostly correspondence, relate to Senator Francis B. Gallagher from Buffalo, New York. Gallagher also served as Treasurer for the Brotherhood's Buffalo district for a time.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">A majority of the letters in the collection is between Gallagher and other senators and senior Fenian members, including Fenian President John O’Neill, President William Randall Roberts, Michael C. Murphy, and Dennis O’Sullivan to name a few. James Gibbons, a printer from Philadelphia and one of the original organizers of the Fenian Brotherhood, is another notable correspondent represented in the collection.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Among other things, the correspondence in this collection reveals the internal divisions and bitter politics that undermined the Fenians’ efforts and ultimately their existence. For example, there are letters between Gallagher and President John O’Neill that reveal a souring relationship between the two as Gallagher aligned himself with a growing faction of members who questioned O’Neill’s leadership. They opposed O’Neill’s aggressive military strategy and use of the organization’s treasury.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The bulk of papers in the collection date between 1866 and 1870, the years when the Fenian Brotherhood was at its height. They document the organization’s activities, including its efforts to raise money and acquire arms as well as its failed attempts to invade Canada. Many of the letters and financial papers relate to the Fenians’ first attempted invasion of Canada which was carried out from Buffalo, New York.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The collection has been organized into two series, Francis B. Gallagher papers and Fenian Brotherhood records. The first series includes letters and financial papers, including invoices and receipts for arms, uniforms, and other supplies, related to Gallagher. The second series includes records of the Brotherhood that do not necessarily relate to the Buffalo Senator. These records include correspondence and financial papers as well as administrative records, such as circular letters, financial reports, departmental reports, and meeting minutes.</p>
