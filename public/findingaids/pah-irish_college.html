Henry began collecting transcripts to be used in a series that would be published in the Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia. The series was titled, "Papers Relating to the Church in America". A total of six series were produced; the first series appeared in 1896 and the final series appeared in 1898. The Transcripts from the Irish College in Rome Records, 1832-1848, comprises of a 360 page transcript of correspondence that originated from the archives of the Irish College in Rome. Topics discussed in the correspondence focus primarily on Catholicity in America during the 19th century. Contents in this collection are considered the unedited transcripts that were most likely used and referenced by the Society for the publication of "Papers Relating to the Church in America: Sixth Series". The series was published in Volume 9 of the 1898 Records of American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia (pages 1-34).</a>

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The typed transcripts in this collection are of correspondence that is part of the Cullen and Kirby Collections housed at the Pontifical Irish College’s Archives. Paul Cullen (1803-1878), the first Irish cardinal, and Tobias Kirby (1804-1895), were two of the most preeminent rectors of the Irish College in Rome. Cullen served as rector from 1821-1849, and was succeeded by Kirby, a priest of the Diocese of Waterford and Lismore, who had served as vice-rector of the College since 1836. Kirby served as rector for forty-one years from 1850 until he retired in 1891.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">In 1896, the American Catholic Historical Society’s Archivist, H. T. Henry, traveled to the Irish College in Rome and transcribed letters from American priests and bishops who had corresponded with Cullen and Kirby. Henry published edited versions of these transcripts in the Records of the American Catholic Historical Society (volumes 7-9). The intent was to document some of people and events connected with the history of Catholicity in North America. Correspondents include Francis P. Kenrick, Peter R. Kenrick, Edward Barron, Michael O’Connor, John England, John Hughes, William Clancy, John Thomas Hynes, Thomas James Power, James Rogers, and John Walsh.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Beginning in the 1896 Records of American Catholic Historical Society Volume 7, the Society began publishing a series of letters dealing primarily with the personages and events connected with the history of Catholicity in America. The Society knew that it was impractical for them to try to write a narrative of the Church in America. Instead, the Society believed it was in the best interest to scholars and students of Catholic history in America to provide some desirable information.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The first and second series can be found in Volume 7, 1896, pages 283-388 and 454-492; the third, fourth, and fifth series can be found in Volume 8, 1897, pages 195-240, 294-329, 450-512; and the sixth and last series can be found in Volume 9, 1898, pages 1-34.</p>

Transcripts were copied from the Portfolio of American Papers in the archives of the Irish College, Rome, where the original can be found. The transcripts were collected by the the archivist of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, H. T. Henry, who most likely used them for the publication of the series titled "Papers Related to the Church in America" found in Volumes 7-9 in the Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia. Nearly all transcripts include the name of the correspondent, recipient, date, and location. All correspondence are in English, with the exception of one that is in Latin; however, the translated copy proceeds the correspondence in Latin.</p>
