                <a name="ref47">Dr. Peter F. Moylan was born in Pittston, Pennsylvania on July 12, 1860. Moylan studied at Wilkes-Barre Academy and later enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1887. Soon after graduation he served his residency in St. Mary's Hospital where he later assumed the charge of the surgical department. On May 4, 1904, Moylan married Miss Nellie A. Drislane of Philadelphia. The couple had three children; Peter F. Moylan Jr., Agnes Margaret Moylan, and Helen Moylan who died while still very young. Moylan eventually led a life that made him a prominent Catholic layman and an esteemed physician. For instance, in 1909, Moylan was made medical director of St. Vincent's Home and Maternity Hospital. He also served as a visiting physician of St. Joseph's Hospital, St. Mary's and Misericordia Hospitals. In terms of his Catholic accomplishments, Moylan was made a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Benedict XV in June of 1917. On September 27, 1922, Pope Pius XI elevated Moylan to the rank of Knight Commander. Moylan died in 1931 at the age of 70. The Dr. Peter F. Moylan Records, 1770-1917, primarily consists of materials related to Moylan’s knighthood by the Pope in 1917. The collection includes correspondence, newsclippings, and a dedication. The collection also contains one series that is somewhat out of scope, 
                Official Legal Documents. This series is included in order to maintain provenance. The series, Official Legal Documents, contains 19th century mortgages, bonds, receipts, deeds, warrants, etc. The archives can only speculate that the official documents were collected as a result of previous land/property ownership by his wife, Nellie Drislane or by Moylan himself.</a>

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Dr. Peter Moylan was a doctor of medicine who lived in Philadelphia. It is this city where he raised a respectable family of two children. Agnes Margaret and Peter Francis respectively with his wife. Their daughter Helen died an early death. Throughout his life, Dr. Moylan believed in a strong, united community and he showed that to the number of people with whom he knew.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">On May 3rd, 1917, Dr. Moylan was elevated to the status of knighthood as the distinguished Knights of St. Gregory. In June of the same year, he was also, in addition to his elevation to knighthood, enrolled among the brothers and sisters of the Order of the St. Augustine by a special indulgence by the Holy See. This favor was bestowed upon him for reasons stemming from his generosity of his time and his natural caring instinct that he had in his ministry of healing the sick of the community in particularly, the leaders of the Catholic Church and the Order of St. Augustine.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Through his profession, he had the privilege of becoming good friends with two Archbishops of Philadelphia.

All in all, Dr. Moylan showed his community good example of a Christian Lifestyle.</p>
