          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Mount Carmel Guild of Newark was established in 1929 by Bishop Thomas J. Walsh as an organization that provided "mental, spiritual and physical relief to individuals receiving public assistance."[1] The Guild was part of the Associated Catholic Charities, which provided family and child welfare services. The Mount Carmel Guild operated a soup kitchen from 1930-1941, offered assistance to those seeking U.S. citizenship starting in the 1930s and formalized as the Office of Migration in 1976, provided ministry to those with physical or mental handicaps, operated a special education school and a psychiatric unit, and participated in social justice causes. In the 1970's, the Mount Carmel Guild ceased to operate as a separate organization and its acitivities were folded into the larger operations of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Newark.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Mount Carmel Guild of the Archdiocese of Newark records include correspondence, newsletters, newsclippings, bills, and scrapbooks describing the activities of the guild. A large portion of the collection is related to the Americanization Department, which offered classes to assist immigrants with obtaining US citizenship. Other activities described include the Apostolate for the Deaf, Project Equality, a housing project, a day care center, a rehabilitation and training center, and an apostolate to the mentally handicapped, among others. Many folders are titled by ministry or activity, while some folders from the 1970's are chronological files containing meeting minutes and notes from multiple ministries.</p>
