          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Legion of Decency was an organization dedicated to determining the moral content (objectionable or acceptable) of motion pictures in the United States. Founded in 1933 as the Catholic Legion of Decency by several Roman Catholic priests and lay persons, the organization included members of many denominations but was primarily composed of Catholics and concerned with the view of the Roman Catholic Church. The Legion was later renamed to the National Legion of Decency, and created its own rating system for determining the moral content of movies, which differed from the ratings system of the Motion Picture Association of America. In the 1960's the organization became the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures, which was then absorbed into the United States Catholic Conference. On June 1, 2001, the USCC merged with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) to form the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops which created its own office for rating films.</p>
