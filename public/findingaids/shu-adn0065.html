          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">The Second Vatican Council took place from 11 October 1962 to 8 December 1965 in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City. It was the 21st Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church and produced a number of documents, decrees, and declarations that addressed the renewal of the Church and its place in the modern world and in relation to other religions. The Council was announced and opened by Pope John XXIII, who died 3 June 1963, and continued and closed by Pope Paul VI, both of whom stressed the pastoral nature and role of the Church. The Council met in four session between 1962-1965 and while only Roman Catholic bishops participated in the sessions, lay Catholics and observers from other religions were present. The Council is seen to mark a great change in the history of the Church, as the effects of its documents were wide-ranging and far-reaching. At the time of the Council, its sessions were well-covered by news media in the United States, particularly Catholic news media.</p>
