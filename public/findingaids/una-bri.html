          <h3>
            <a name="a2"> Background </a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Joseph Breig was born in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, on February 28, 1905, the son of George and Clara (McKenzie) Breig. George Breig was an electrical contractor. Joseph was educated at St. Vincent Preparatory School, Latrobe, Pennsylvania (1918-1920), and graduated from Vandergrift High School in 1923. He entered the University of Notre Dame in September 1923 and left again in September 1924 due to his family's tight budget. He returned in September 1925 and finally left Notre Dame in June 1927 without receiving a degree. At Notre Dame Breig was active in student journalism, writing for the Dome, the Juggler and the Scholastic. He became editor of the Scholastic and was also a member of the Scribblers. In 1930 he married Mary Agnes Hoffman of Vandergrift. Together they had seven children, five of whom survived infancy. His son, James P. Breig, works as editor of the Evangelist, the official weekly newspaper of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany, New York. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Breig began his professional career in 1924 when he went to work for the Vandergrift News. He later became the editor and continued there until 1934. Starting in 1930 he also worked for the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph as rewrite and feature writer. He had his own column ("One Man's Opinion", 1940-1945) and covered City Hall for the paper. During 1943-1944 he also wrote a column for the Pittsburgh Catholic Observer. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> With his increasing interest in Catholicism, Breig decided that he would rather work for a Catholic newspaper. For this reason he moved to Cleveland in 1945 and became assistant editor of the Universe Bulletin there. Breig had his own column and worked as a rewrite man and headline writer. He edited National Catholic News Service copy, condensed stories, and answered phone calls and letters of complaint, often from readers objecting to things Breig had written in his columns. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Over the years the topics for his columns included a vast number of subjects, including his efforts to outlaw boxing, his doubts of the genuineness of the apparitions of Garabandal and Bayside, his defense of the Vietnam War, and his opposition to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. He also commented on statements by opponents of his Catholic beliefs such as Father Andrew Greeley, Father Hans Küng, the John Birch Society, and others who, in his view, tried to alter the Church's teachings on divorce, artificial birth control, and papal infallibility. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Breig stayed at the Universe Bulletin until his retirement in March 1975. He continued to write his columns after 1975. They appeared not only in the Universe Bulletin but also in several other Catholic newspapers in the USA. Besides being a newspaper writer, Breig also wrote for many magazines (Ave Maria, Our Lady's Digest, The Family Digest, Crozier, and others) and published eight books and several short stories and plays. In honor of his work he received two honorary doctorates (St. Vincent College, Latrobe, Pennsylvania, 1954, and Carroll College, Helena, Montana, 1967). He also won several awards, one of which was the St. Francis de Sales Award from the Catholic Press Association in 1966. Joseph Breig died of a heart attack at Longwood, Florida, on February 6, 1982. </p>

            <a name="a3"> Scope and Content </a>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Correspondence, manuscripts, and printed material including clippings and offprints of articles, columns, and book reviews; representing Breig's interest in Catholicism, the Garabandal Apparitions, abortion, and Humanae Vitae; with samples of editorial work and promotional material, cartoons by Earl Wolf based on ideas suggested by Breig, and poems by Breig's friends; also a small quantity of photographs, certificates and drawings by Breig, including material from both his private and professional life. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> The collection consists of seven series: correspondence, chronological file, writings, editorial work, personal material, restricted material, and miscellaneous items. The papers span a period of 93 years from 1888 through 1981, though there is little material for the years 1888-1923 and 1928-1940, mostly just family correspondence and documents. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> The bulk of the correspondence falls into the years 1923-1928 (when Breig was a student at Notre Dame) and from 1971-1981 . For the years in between little correspondence has survived. After Father Hesburgh approached Joseph Breig about donating his papers to Notre Dame in 1974, the volume of the correspondence saved increased considerably. Breig's writings are represented by both manuscripts and clippings. There are manuscripts of his books (published and unpublished), plays, short stories, articles, columns, book reviews, and speeches. While the manuscripts of his work as a writer date mostly from only the 1930s until the late 1950s, his work as a newspaperman is very well documented. There is an almost complete set of clippings of his columns from his days at the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph (1940- 1945), from the Pittsburgh Catholic Observer (1943- 1944), and from the Cleveland Catholic Universe Bulletin 
(1945-1981). His columns also appeared in other Catholic newspapers, some of which are also included in this collection. There are manuscripts and clippings of articles for Catholic magazines and a few miscellaneous pieces as well. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Some of Breig's work as an editor is documented in his correspondence regarding reader's letters (policy explanations, etc.), rewrites of NC News copy, background material for his columns, style and writing manuals (some of which Breig composed or contributed to), and editorial cartoons suggested by Breig and drawn by Earl Wolf. Only the background material folders about Abortion, Vietnam and the apparitions of Garabandal were created by Breig; the rest of these folders were created from material in his miscellaneous folders. Breig saved little in the way of background material until 1974 when he became aware that Notre Dame was interested in his papers. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> In the personal material series one can find letters and other documents that Breig later annotated for explanatory reasons as well as personal documents and certificates (like his honorary doctorates), some documents about his relatives, clippings about Joseph Breig (his work, books and plays, awards, etc.), clippings about his family, photos of Breig and his family and relatives, and a family genealogy covering 1834 - circa 1977. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> The last two series are very small and consist of only two folders, one of restricted material, the other of a few things that couldn't be linked to existing series or folders. </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30pt"> Further information about Breig's donation of his papers to the Notre Dame Archives is found in the correspondence series (box 1, folder 9). </p>

          </h3>
          <p>Letters sent and received by Breig and a smaller amount of family correspondence. Divided into two sub-series (FAMILY LETTERS and GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE). Each sub-series is arranged chronologically with a few folders arranged by subject. Correspondence after 1974 is filed in the CHRONOLOGICAL FILE below. </p>
          <p>FAMILY LETTERS (1888-1947, 2.5") consists of letters exchanged between Breig's parents, siblings, and other relatives as well as of letters Breig wrote to his family during his time away at school and after he left home, through 1947. The letters with the Universe Bulletin letterhead are found in this sub-series because of their private nature. One can also find a few official letters from Notre Dame to Breig's parents. </p>
          <p>Breig must have inherited some of these letters from his parents because they are not addressed to him -- some even date from atime when he wasn't yet born. Some of these letters are from his siblings to his parents and others are letters between his parents, letters from other relatives to his parents, and so on. But most of these letters somehow deal with Joseph Breig. </p>
          <p>The letters are generally only news updates to inform other family members of what was going on. The bulk of this sub-series consists of letters from Joseph Breig to his family while at Notre Dame (1923-1927?). Some letters carry the letterhead of the Scribblers Club and one folder consist only of undated letters with the Scholastic letterhead. These letters deal for the most part with things of a private nature -- more money for expenses, sending his washing home, etc. He also writes about his teachers (Shuster -- Literature; Kaczmarek -- Biology; Cooney -- Journalism; Phillips -- English, Poetry, world literature, Dante, playwriting; Fr. Cavanaugh -- drama class; Becker -- History of Music; Fr. Healy -- Shakespeare; Fr. MacNamara -- History); how the Notre Dame football, basketball, and baseball teams have played; his encounters with the Ku Klux Klan in South Bend; his friend Red Smith; his visits to the movie theater (Hunchback of Notre Dame at the Oliver Theater), concerts (Fritz Kreisler and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra playing Strauss, St. Patrick's Choir of Chicago: The Lass of Limerick Town at Washington Hall); his work for the Scholastic (he was editor-in-chief) and the Dome; his membership in the Scribblers (he was secretary and treasurer); the stories he published and literature contests he won for his stories (Culver College); his grades. His letters give a good insight into campus life from a student's point of view. The sub-series contains only letters sent by Breig to his family and no letters received by him. </p>
          <p>GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE (1941-1974, 1') contains almost all of Breig's extant correspondence until the end of 1974 except for what is to be found below in EDITORIAL WORK and PERSONAL MATERIAL. Fully half of the letters in this sub-series date from 1973 and 1974. This sub-series covers a broad spectrum of topics including columns by Joseph Breig, abortion, church-press relations, Father Andrew Greeley, G. K. Chesterton, Breig's trip to Israel, the beatification of Mother Seton, congratulations and greetings. Correspondents include his family (his sister, Sister Regina Clare, and his son James Breig, editor of the Evangelist in particular), several priests (especially Patrick Peyton CSC) and bishops, various Catholic organizations, the Vatican, politicians (Congressmen, Senators, Mayors of Cleveland, etc.), the Jewish Community in the United States (Sidney Z. Vincent, Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland, etc.), officials from the State of Israel regarding his trip to Israel, friends (especially Genevieve Blatt, judge at the Commonwealth Court, Harrisburg, PA), the University of Notre Dame (including Fr. Hesburgh), and publishers of his books. </p>
          <p>In his position as associate editor and columnist of the three northern Ohio Catholic papers of Toledo, Cleveland and Youngstown he also received many letters from readers. The readers expressed their approval or disagreement with the paper and his columns. He often answered these letters. Similar letters are found in the EDITORIAL WORK series under LETTERS RE SUBMISSIONS. There are also quite a few letters to and from colleagues inside the Universe Bulletin (especially editor Edgar Barmann) and editors from other American Catholic papers and magazines. There are also a number of letters from Breig to editors of the secular and Catholic press in which he expresses his opinion towards articles and columns that appeared in their publications. </p>
          <p>Three folders of subject files complete this series. The first contains correspondence between Breig and Notre Dame about the donation of his papers to the Notre Dame Archives. This folder provides a good look at the donation process and the difficulties that went along with it. The next folder contains letters about Breig's writings while he was at the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph (1941-1945). The last folder is a collection of letters Breig received when he won the St. Francis de Sales Award in 1966. </p>

          <p>The CHRONOLOGICAL FILE consists of all types of Breig documents dating from 1975 until November 1981. These documents were a second accession to the original shipment of papers to the Notre Dame Archives. The accession has been sorted into chronological order, but in general has been kept as it arrived at the Archives. Only the material dating before 1975, the Breig family genealogy (now in the PERSONAL MATERIAL series), and loose clippings (now in the WRITINGS and PERSONAL MATERIAL series) have been removed from this series and filed elsewhere. </p>
          <p>There is a folder for every month of every year from 1975 until November 1981. At the end of each year there is also a folder with papers that could be connected to the year but not to a particular month. This series generally consists of correspondence, columns, articles, book reviews, etc. The nature of the correspondence is basically the same as described in the CORRESPONDENCE series. Breig corresponds with his family, his son James (assistant editor of the Evangelist), his sister Mary (Sister Regina Clare), his daughter Mary and her husband Terry (Brock), his cousin David Harley (West Virginia) and his cousin Ferd McKenzie (Dakota). Breig's correspondence with his son often deals with James' work as assistant editor of the Evangelist. Other private correspondence is also about his activities in his parish, with Breig's and his wife's friends, and with his fellow alumni from Notre Dame. Even though he retired in February 1975 this accession contains much correspondence with readers, clergy, editors of Catholic newspapers and magazines, and politicians. Abortion, homosexuals, and criticism and support of his opinions are among the topics of these letters. </p>
          <p>This series also contains an abundance of manuscripts of columns. For the years before 1975 such manuscripts are found in the WRITINGS series. Breig wrote about various topics in religion, family, politics, sports, and nature. His articles for that period are mostly about religious subjects, and his book reviews are on books about journalism, sports, family, grammar, and religion. Breig repeatedly wrote about abortion, euthanasia, women in the Catholic church, artificial contraception, Humanae Vitae, busing, the death penalty, the Equal Rights Amendment, Archbishop Lefebvre, Father Andrew Greeley, Father Hans Küng, the theory of evolution and the theory of creation, the speed limit, homosexuality, boxing, the Olympic Games, and political issues like the Near East conflict, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, and the Vietnam war. Many columns contain Breig's defense of papal decisions and policy. </p>

          <p>This series contains all of Breig's pre-1975 manuscripts, offprints and clippings as well as clippings of many of his later writings. The rest of the clippings and manuscripts for the 1975-1981 period are found in the CHRONOLOGICAL FILE. </p>
          <p>The manuscripts of five books (The Devil You Say, A Halo For The Father, Life With My Mary, The Family And The Cross, and Mysteries Of Marriage) can be found in BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS. Included with the manuscripts are disassembled scrapbooks (now in folders) and other related materials like promotion portfolios, reviews, correspondence, and clippings. For God In Our House and My Pants When I Die the manuscripts have not survived, but there are scrapbooks, promotion portfolios, etc. As a matter of form those have been filed in this sub-series. A folder of pamphlets by Breig concludes this sub-series. Some of these pamphlets are reprints of magazine articles and some of them have been written with the support of these magazines and newspapers. </p>
          <p>The UNPUBLISHED BOOKS AND ABANDONED WRITINGS sub-series consists of five manuscripts of unpublished books and three unfinished book manuscripts. Most of these manuscripts are undated. For the unpublished books Breig couldn't find a publishing house. He abandoned the other manuscripts because he found out that mystery novels weren't his strength or because he didn't get anywhere with his topic. Most of these manuscripts are annotated by Breig. </p>
          <p>PLAYS contains three manuscripts (The Pump, The New Sin, Stars In The Earth). Breig wrote The Pump while he still was at Notre Dame. It was put on stage there also. His play The New Sin appeared on the stage in Pittsburgh. There are several articles about this play in the PERSONAL MATERIAL series in the Clippings about Joseph Breig folder (box 10, folder 32). The remaining play Stars In The Earth was, according to Breig, never produced. </p>
          <p>The SHORT STORIES sub-series consists of several manuscripts and two printed short stories. In his annotation to "The End Of The Old Women" Breig wrote that among all his writings this is his favorite. The two printed stories were published while he was still a student at Notre Dame. One appeared in the Notre Dame Anthology (1927) the other one in Stepping Stones to Catholic Classics (1926). The last folder contains several undated short stories, some of which are also untitled. </p>
          <p>The most extensive sub-series is ARTICLES, BOOK REVIEWS, AND COLUMNS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. It is divided between newspapers and magazines. Newspapers manuscripts, carbons, and clippings come first and are followed by their magazine counterparts. The newspaper part has been further divided into articles, book reviews, and columns sections. This distinction has not been made for the magazines. </p>
          <p>The carbons of newspaper articles (3") are mostly undated. The exception is a folder with unpublished articles from the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph which is dated from around 1942. Clippings of newspaper articles embrace the years 1945-1974. Some articles can also be found in a scrapbook that likewise contains book reviews and another folder with articles and book reviews. Those two folders (box 5, folders 15 and 16) have been filed with the book reviews. </p>
          <p>Breig wrote many book reviews which were for the most part, published by the NC News Service. There are therefore two folders (1.5") with NC News Service wire-service print-outs in this sub-series. Books he reviewed were about the Near East Crisis, the press and the media in general, religion, and politics. </p>
          <p>Manuscripts and clippings of newspaper columns (2') account for the bulk of material in this sub-series. There are undated manuscripts of columns Breig wrote for the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, carbons of columns for the Cleveland Catholic Universe Bulletin for the years 1947-1948, mostly undated carbons of his syndicated weekly columns, and manuscripts of columns for 1974-1975. Following the carbons and manuscripts one can find an almost complete set of clippings of his columns in various newspapers from 1940 until 1981. </p>
          <p>In the early years while he still worked at the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph the topics of his columns tended to be secular. With his move to the Universe Bulletin his columns concentrated more on religious topics, but he still commented on current political issues and other things that interested him. Otherwise the topics are not different from those described in the CHRONOLOGICAL FILE series, above. </p>
          <p>There are some folders that contain only columns about special subjects. One is about an abandoned child (box 5, folder 35), one is about Joseph Breig's trip to Israel, 1968 (box 6, folder 51),and the last is about American Catholic intellectual inferiority (box 6, folder 71). At the end of the columns section there is a folder with clippings of readers' letters on Breig's columns (box 6, folder 72). </p>
          <p>At the beginning of the magazine manuscripts and clippings section (1'7") one can find two small folders with clippings of Breig's articles in his high school and college papers (the Spectator and the Scholastic). He was editor of both papers. These are followed by a list of articles which Breig sent to various Catholic magazines. The list embraces the years 1943-1950. It is not clear that this a comprehensive list of his articles for the period. Breig wrote articles for a large number of Catholic magazines. In contrast to the order of the newspaper writings section, manuscripts and clippings of magazine articles are all filed together by magazine. Many of the manuscripts are undated and not all of the magazines have manuscripts or clippings accompanying them. Most of the articles are from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s and only some are from the 1970s and 1980s. </p>
          <p>The end of this sub-series is formed by twelve folders of miscellaneous writings (3.75"). It is impossible to determine where these have been published, or even if they have been published, as many of them are untitled and undated. These writings are about the same subjects as his columns and range from 1939 to 1975. </p>
          <p>SPEECHES is the last sub-series of this series. It contains two folders (1") with manuscripts of different speeches that Breig gave at various occasions. Most of the speeches are identified as to time and place of delivery. Sometimes Breig annotated them for explanation, as well. The time span ranges from 1951 until 1975. </p>

          <p>This series consists of material that concerns Breig's work as an editor for the Catholic Universe Bulletin and the other two Northern Ohio diocesan newspapers. Except for the SUBJECT FILES it dates generally from the late sixties through the mid-seventies. </p>
          <p>CORRESPONDENCE REGARDING SUBMISSIONS consists of letters to and from Breig in his function as associate editor of the three northern Ohio diocesan newspapers. Most of his letters contain an explanation of the newspapers' policy and why they can't publish certain letters to the editor. He also answered questions from readers who wanted information from the Universe Bulletin on various topics. This type of correspondence can also be found in GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE and the CHRONOLOGICAL FILE. One can assume that Breig kept these folders for 1972-1974 only because he had been approached by Notre Dame in 1974 about the donating his papers to the Archives. </p>
          <p>EDITORIAL WORK contains papers that show how Breig wrote his columns, how he rewrote NC News Service stories, and how he wrote his own news stories (that he himself researched). One can also find much correspondence which does not necessarily deal with his professional work, but which has been kept here because it had been filed here by Breig. This sub-series spans the years 1966-1974. The rewrite samples account for three-fourths of the material. </p>
          <p>The SUBJECT FILES was, for the most part, created from approximately ten folders of miscellany concerning topics that Breig wrote about in his columns. For that reason it seemed best to add to the three existing subject folders (Apparitions of Garabandal, Vietnam War and abortion) fourteen new subject files. Two already existing folders (both titled Catholic Press, Liaison Journalism CPA, NCWS) have been removed from the EDITORIAL WORK sub-series and were filed here. These files date for the most part from the 1960s and 1970s with some material from the 1940s and the 1980s. The files about abortion account for the biggest share of the subject files. There are three STYLE AND WRITING MANUALS. Breig was co-author of the Holy Childhood Press Manual and single author of How To Write Human Interest Features. The style sheet of the Catholic Press Union was used by the Universe Bulletin. </p>
          <p>CARTOONS BY EARL WOLF end this series. Earl Wolf made these cartoon drawings for the Universe Bulletin and the NC News Service. The cartoons found here are all based on suggestions from Breig. The first folder contains the manuscripts of Breig's ideas for the drawings. The rest hold the drawings. A third of the drawings are undated; the rest span from 1965 to 1974. The topics of these cartoons parallel the subjects of Breig's columns. </p>

          <p>PERSONAL MATERIAL is divided in five sub-series. The first sub-series consists of papers, articles, columns, articles by other authors, and correspondence that Breig thought significant and therefore annotated for explanatory reasons. The annotations are very complete and are significant documents in themselves. </p>
          <p>The second sub-series is a collection of documents and certificates belonging to Breig and his family as well as papers and documents (Testaments of George and Clara Breig) that belonged to Breig's parents and aunts. Breig's own documents include his two honorary degrees. </p>
          <p>The third sub-series contains clippings of articles about Breig as well as clippings about his immediate family (mostly his son James). </p>
          <p>The fourth sub-series contains a family history for his father's side of the family as well as a fragment of a genealogy written by Breig's brother Robert which also includes their mother's side of the family. There is also folder with clippings about the rest of Breig's family. </p>
          <p>The photos of this sub-series have been removed (as have all other photos of this collection) to the Breig photo collection (GBRI).Photocopies of the photo have been left in this sub-series. The photos show Breig as a little boy; Breig and his siblings; Breig in his high school yearbook (1923); Breig with a friend; Breig in the Notre Dame yearbook (1927); his family, 1950; Breig in the 1960s, and Breig with colleagues at the regional Catholic Press Convention in Youngstown, Ohio, 1976. </p>
