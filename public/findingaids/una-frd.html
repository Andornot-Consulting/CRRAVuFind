				1885  He sends General James Shields ' letter and envelope so that Ford can have a photo made of it and print it with the articles on General Carr . Some might otherwise say that General Shields did not write the letter which he has inserted in the sketch of Carr. He prizes the letter highly; Ford must not let anything happen to it.

				1885 Feb. 4  Not having heard from Ford she concluded that he had not heard from Father Edward McGlynn in relation to the parties she was speaking about. She read of Ford's libel suit; John W. Mahan is causing all his trouble as he did hers. Mahan has given Ford away; he wrote to Senator Arthur Pue Gorman just after Ford called at the house with Judge   Carroll during the last campaign. He wrote the letter under an assumed name; the Republican party is down on Mahan about the affair which is well known in Boston; Mahan has few friends left in Boston. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 3pp. 12 mo. </div>

				1885 Feb. 5  A letter from his brother, David F. Mahan of Chelsea, Massachusetts mentioned that Ford had called at the house to look over the "9th Regiment Roster." Mahan has been in New Orleans and the letter did not reach him until today. He will be in Washington for a time and Ford can get in touch with him there.

He will send the electrotype plates and the unused stereotype matter in a day or two. Some one sent him J. O'Donovan Rossa's paper with an account of the Rellikan case -- a bad thing to stir up.

Ford should send the proof of the article that was delayed. The First Minnesota Regiment contained many Irish-Americans and deserves glory. He needs a secretary but must go it alone for lack of appropriation. P.S. Mahan had the satisfaction of nominating General Ulysses S. Grant for the presidency of the Army of the Potomac. :: I-1-k L.S. 3pp. 8 vo. </div>

He expects her to send a picture of General Thomas Francis Meagher . He speaks of various photographs and drawings. Ford sent copies of letters that Mahan wanted Patrick Ford  to keep on file; Mahan wants letters of General John Bradford?

				1885 Jun. 30  He thanks Ford for the check. Patrick Ford 's ideas run in the same channel as his; it was the case with the article on the part taken by the clergy and he has mapped out a special chapter for the part taken by the Sisters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy . He will drive around to see Ballen. Mahan's Meagher article will please Patrick and others and he hopes it will lead to a closer study of old Irish legends and the history of Ireland. It is lamentable how little the young Irish Americans know of these matters. He speaks of his writing General Thomas Francis Meagher 's life. From what Mahan saw when in New York, he thinks Ford works too hard. The Irish World has a staff sufficient for a daily; Ford should tell them what to do and have them attend to tasks at once. He had an idea for a "Grand Army Irish World" and speaks of increasing circulation. Ford should remember the photographs of Archbishop John Hughes and Father Sylvester? Malone. He has some orders for the book. He received a letter from Macnamara which speaks for itself. A letter from Patrick would help. A.L.S. 6pp. Enclosure: </div>

It is considered the Governor will selected two out and out Americans and one of Irish nationality. Patrick Ford, Col. A.A. Rend, General Martin, Dr. Green, or W.W. Doherty might have influence or say a word in his behalf. A.L.S. 2pp. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 8pp. 4to., 12mo. 12 </div>

He has a mass of letters asking when the work will be ready.   Riordan of the Irish Brigade now in Ottumwa, Iowa has been nominated for representative; Mahan gives a short sketch of his Irish loyalty and asks that Ford print an article on him so that he can use it in the campaign. Mahan asks Ford and his uncle Patrick Ford  for political recommendations for Martin V. Casey, a clerk who may soon be subject to changes which will be announced October 1. He asks Ford to see General Henry Warner Slocum for a letter and to have him send one to General William S. Rosecrans, who is responsible for the office in which Casey is employed. He anxiously awaits an answer. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 4pp. 4to. </div>

Ford should find out what the General thinks of it. Mahan thinks no account has been published of this part of the line at Gettysburg where Carr's brigade was in action. He discusses the handling of proof. He thinks there is a good demand for the life of Meagher; Meagher's words of 1848 would be appropriate now if Charles Stuart Parnell really said that if Ireland were given a legislative body she would stand up loyally and fight for the Empire as devotedly as any of England's colonies. That is bosh, and he would not give a dime to such a movement. He will send a photograph of himself taken on a visit to Gettysburg; Ford already has one taken in uniform in 1863. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 4pp. 4to. </div>

He has kept the Levan Company off by paying sums of interest, but cost of photographs kept him from doing so this month, and the result is a preemptory demand for $100, the balance due. He hoped to realize something the next winter from the book and regrets its delay. He would like to see the columns in type. The article on General Joseph Bradford Carr reads well, but there is nothing to indicate authorship. Patrick's letter on the "Invincibles" read at the banquet has the right ring and must attract attention. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 2pp. 4to. </div>

Captain Henpel asked him to thank Ford for the interest in the case of Patrick Ginley. Henpel was second in the examination for the weighership, but was delighted that O'Brien, one of the 69th came out first. Henpel mingles more with the Irish than with those of his own nationality. He speaks of the interpretation of a new civil service law, the actions of   Eaton of Indiana. If Ford would print it he would write a letter on William? Saltonstall, fur trade, and the resurrection of the "Old Silver Guy" party. Saltonstall spoke for John Bell and Edward Everett in 1860, and denounced the Democratic party, and the ignorant and depraved class, the Irish, Mahan hissed the scandalous remarks.

In this case and in all Pope Leo XIII's doings, McQuaid is in hearty sympathy. Corrigan can attach McQuaid's name to the letter. Father Terence J.? Early served notification of the three ecclesiastical members of the board of trustees. McQuaid probably will not go to New York before Feb. 2. Should Bishop Richard Gilmour be at home this week. McQuaid will go to Cleveland for two or three days. McQuaid wrote a sharp letter to Ella B . Edes about the ignoring of the Provincial Council of New York. It is too soon to hear from Rome about the Father James S. O'Sullivan case. McQuaid has just imported from France a pontifical set of white vestments for Holy Thursday. The expense was amazingly small. If Corrigan sees them, he will want them, also, only richer. What will do in Rochester will not suit Fifth Avenue, New York. Saturday, McQuaid completed 38 years of priesthood. He has heard stories about Seton Hall 's discipline which distress him. He hopes they are exaggerated. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 4pp. 12 mo.

McQuaid asks Corrigan if he should follow up the affair. Should he charge   McElhone with the authorship without saying what is the source of authority? No sheriff so far. The threat was only a bit of weak blackmailing. McQuaid believed the threat meant business and felt justified in calling on Corrigan to hinder a neighboring Bishop from shutting his eyes to an ecclesiastic who sells chalices and vestments to get money which he could get, if found to be justly due, by bringing his case before an ecclesiastical tribunal. </div>

As for the paper he fears he will have to let it go and turn his hopes elsewhere as the offer of $10,000 cash is better than his offer of $5,000 and 50% of the collections. He has not as yet sold his property. Munson believes that he could collect most of the subscription list that is solvent; he did not mean to limit Ford's payments with any idea that he would not get $13,000 out of it. Munson makes another offer which he details and will be glad to have Ford keep him in mind as a future purchaser. Ford may be sure that he will treat any information he has given him thus far as confidential. Although he consulted with several friends and acquaintances in New York he is sure that he has said nothing Ford would object to. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 2pp. 4to. </div>

				1891 Dec. 22  He has nearly finished his brief for the Supreme Court in the Ohio school case. Feeling is so red-hot on the school question because of the utterances of Rev. Dr. Thomas J. Bouquillon, Father Rene I. Holaind, and Archbishop John Ireland that he has written to Ohio to inquire whether the Supreme Judges will waive the point of etiquette and allow him to let Ford publish in advance of the hearing as Ford suggests. He would like to have a conference with Ford about it. He encloses a calling card, and two pictures of himself. :: I-1-k A.L.S. 2pp. 12mo. </div>

His father has written him a pitiful letter asking for some help; he sent him $10 for Christmas, but would like to send $15 more if Ford will advance him the amount.
