          <p style="margin-left: 30pt">Jim McLaughlin was a photographer for the Dome yearbook and Scholastic magazine during his time as a student from 1946-1951.  These photographs came to the University Archives from Bruce Harlan as part of the University Photographer Office Collection (GPHR; accession #1993-37).  McLaughlin's widow gave the negatives to Harlan.  McLaughlin and Harlan were student photographers together.</p>
